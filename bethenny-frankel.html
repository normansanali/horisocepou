She is currently 52 years old. Her father, Robert J Frankel, and mother, Bernadette Birk, gave birth to her. As a result, her father was a well-known figure in horse training. In addition, he was the recipient of several Eclipse Awards. Similarly, her mother worked as an interior designer. Her father abandoned her mother when she was four years old. They were in financial trouble because her father had stopped proving money.</p><p>Her mother later married horse trainer John Parisella. She soon began working at her biological father’s stable.</p><h2>Bethenny Frankel Education</h2><p>She did not abandon her education and instead pursued it. In 1988, she graduated from Pine Crest School in Florida. She went on to study psychology and communications at New York University.</p><h2>Bethenny Frankel Height, Weight</h2><p>Bethenny Frankel is attractive and stunning. As a result, there are no specifics about her body measurements, dress size, height, weight, and so on. She does, however, have short brown hair and brown pairs of attractive eyes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bethenny-Franke-1.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p>In the early 1990s, Bethenny Frankel began auditioning for small roles following her studies. She eventually landed a job as a production assistant on the set of Saved by the Bell. Unfortunately, as soon as the job ended, she was out of money. Later on, she began working as a nanny, and she also cared for Paris Hilton, who was a teenager at the time. She eventually landed a steady job as Jerry Bruckheimer’s personal assistant. Fortunately, she started her own business. She started a party planning business in the late 1990s, which failed miserably.</p><p>Later, she launched a business selling pashmina scarves, which also failed. She has made the decision to return to school. It was in 2002 that I decided to pursue a gourmet specialization at the Natural Gourmet Institute.</p><p>She also started a company called Bethenny Bakes after graduating. Unfortunately, Bethenny Bakes was a flop like the others. In 2005, her baking background aided her entry into a reality show. She appeared on The Apprentice: Martha Stewart as a contestant.

Did she appear in the show Bethenny Getting Married? The show was primarily about her journey toward marriage. The show premiered in 2010 and received high ratings. Eventually, the show became popular with the audience.</p><p>In addition, in 2009, she decided to capitalize on her image by writing a book. The title of the book was ‘Naturally Thin: Unleash Your SkinnyGirl and Break Free from a Lifetime of Dieting.’ Furthermore, SkinnyGirl became Bethenny’s brand, and she plans to release three more books in the coming years. Similarly, she founded SkinnyGirl Cocktails, a beverage company that dismissed the possibility of gaining weight. Soon after, in 2013, she launched her own talk show, Bethenny.</p><h2>Bethenny Frankel Husband, Marriage</h2><p>In 1996, Bethenny Frankel married a Hollywood executive, Peter Sussman. They later divorce after a year due to personal reasons. In March 2010, she married pharmaceutical sales executive Jason Hoppy. She was a few months pregnant at the time of her marriage.</p><p>As a result, her second marriage was broadcast on television via her reality show Bethenny Getting Married? In the same year, she gave birth to her daughter, Bryn. She filed for divorce in January 2013 and reached an agreement for Bryn’s custody in 2014. Finally, in July 2016, the divorce was finalized.
