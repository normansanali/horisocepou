The journey wasn't always smooth, however. The cruise shut down for a little while in order for renovations to take place.

It was an exciting way for his fans to connect with him even more. As Travel and Leisure reported, the bar was going to be called the "5 o'Clock Somewhere Bar," which was inspired by the song of the same name by Alan Jackson and Buffett.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Jimmy Buffett’s Net Worth Permanently Damaged By His Heartbreaking Health Struggles?</a></span></p><p>According to The Palm Beach Post, the cruise ship called the Margaritaville Paradise was on the water in May 2022. It had 658 cabins and 10 passenger decks. Each had better carpet and a TV, which sounds nice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jimmy Buffett said when talking about the cruise, “the only thing better than being on a beach by the ocean is to be on the ocean. Now you can follow in our wake.”</p><p>In May 2023, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Margaritaville At Sea was canceled</a> for renovations. According to Cruiseradio.net, the ship was renovated for a period of 10 days taking place between May 2st and June 1st. The publication noted that while details weren't shared, the spring 2022 renovation included better bars and restaurants and different paint.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jimmy-buffett-5.jpg><p>Jimmy Buffett fans can sign up for a cruise through the official website.

The ship starts in Palm Beach and travels to Grand Bahama Island.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are several restaurants to choose from, including the Cheeseburger in Paradise Burger Bar and Frank & Lola's Pizzeria.

The "Fine Dining" restaurant has delicious menu items ranging from Florida Hush Puppies to Cajun Gumbo and Butter Poached Lobster Tails.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-jimmy-buffett-make-from-margaritaville-at-sea>How Much Money Did Jimmy Buffett Make From Margaritaville At Sea?</h2><p>Since Jimmy Buffett had a $1 billion net worth, fans can guess that he made a lot of money from Margaritaville At Sea. As it turns out, the entire <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Margaritaville brand was very lucrative for Buffett</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jimmy-buffett-6.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Florida Today, Forbes reported in 2017 that, when adding up the profits from touring, albums, and the various companies that the singer had, Buffett made $50.5 million. The Margaritaville Chief Executive Officer, John Cohlan, said in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Margaritaville had yearly sales figures of $1.5 billion.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Much Jimmy Buffett's Estate Is Worth (And Who Stands To Inherit It)</a></span></p><p>While exact figures are unknown, Jimmy Buffett definitely made money from Margaritaville At Sea. It seems that profits would have been shared between those in charge. According to the official website, Kevin Sheenan Jr. is the President of the Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line, the company that teamed up with Margaritaville to create this new cruise line. Those working for Margaritaville must make money from this venture as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/th-image-template-1-4.jpg><p>In 2022, Jimmy Buffett talked about Margaritaville At Sea in an interview with USA Today. He praised the people who work for the cruise and said that they did a great job making sure everything was organized.</p><p>He said, "The teams at every level, from the performance to the transition team, were amazing and that’s what you want. I kind of run my band like a good ship; some days are good, some not and it could all go to hell in 15 minutes." He continued, "We are veterans of all of this, but you rely on the camaraderie of everyone in every aspect of running a show."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Buffett also talked about creating the cruise and explained, "I’m a sponge of ideas. My business partner (John Cohlan) said it’s the unexpected phone call that comes along and you say, that sounds interesting. That’s how this started (with the ship). It’s got to be the right time, the right feeling and there has to be a lot of luck in it, too. But the boat was it for me."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jimmy Buffett Revealed The Four Things He Wanted To Do Before He Passed Away</a></span></p><p>It makes sense that Margaritaville At Sea would start in Florida and head for the Bahamas as Florida always had an incredibly special place in Jimmy Buffett's heart.</p><p>According to CBS News, Buffett shared that after he was divorced from Jane Slavsgol at the beginning of the 1980s, he was no longer living in Nashville. He was trying to make his music career happen. He said that he started playing at The Flick, a cafe in Miami, and lived with Jerry Jeff Walker, whom he had interviewed once for Billboard magazine. This connection helped him find a home in Key West.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jimmy-buffett-3.jpg><p>Buffett explained, "After the first album came out I went touring across the U.S. but until '72 I was basically staying alive by working gigs in South Florida."</p><p>Jimmy Buffett always seemed to be in a good mood, and it sounds like he got a lot of pleasure out of creating various businesses.</p><p>As for whether his fans responded positively to Margaritaville At Sea, there are some mixed reviews on Cruise Critic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One customer wrote, "We had a blast! Food and drinks were great. If you’re looking for an ultra luxury ship with Vegas style shows and water slides, this is not that cruise. It’s a 2-night party. We met so many fun people." Another review called it "deteriorating" and said that the food was "mediocre." For the most part, though, the reviews are great, and people seem thrilled to get the chance to sail on such a fun boat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lmp66rsWMm6yfnpWpeq6typ5kn6qfonqurdGgmKuhpJbDqrjLnmSarF2osqJ5wqusoquVYq%2Bmtc2gZJyZnpiyrbHDZp2oql2nsq%2B71ZqroqeeqHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-did-jimmy-buffet-make-from-margaritaville-at-sea-cruise-being-canceled-for-renovations.html&text=Did%20Jimmy%20Buffet%20Make%20A%20Fortune%20From%20Margaritaville%20At%20Sea%20Despite%20The%20Cruise%20Being%20Canceled%20For%20Ren&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-did-jimmy-buffet-make-from-margaritaville-at-sea-cruise-being-canceled-for-renovations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-did-jimmy-buffet-make-from-margaritaville-at-sea-cruise-being-canceled-for-renovations.html&title=Did%20Jimmy%20Buffet%20Make%20A%20Fortune%20From%20Margaritaville%20At%20Sea%20Despite%20The%20Cruise%20Being%20Canceled%20For%20Ren" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-did-jimmy-buffet-make-from-margaritaville-at-sea-cruise-being-canceled-for-renovations.html&title=Did%20Jimmy%20Buffet%20Make%20A%20Fortune%20From%20Margaritaville%20At%20Sea%20Despite%20The%20Cruise%20Being%20Canceled%20For%20Ren" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-did-jimmy-buffet-make-from-margaritaville-at-sea-cruise-being-canceled-for-renovations.html&title=Did%20Jimmy%20Buffet%20Make%20A%20Fortune%20From%20Margaritaville%20At%20Sea%20Despite%20The%20Cruise%20Being%20Canceled%20For%20Ren" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-did-jimmy-buffet-make-from-margaritaville-at-sea-cruise-being-canceled-for-renovations.html&description=Did%20Jimmy%20Buffet%20Make%20A%20Fortune%20From%20Margaritaville%20At%20Sea%20Despite%20The%20Cruise%20Being%20Canceled%20For%20Ren" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emma-thompson-and-kenneth-branagh-the-way-they-were.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh: The Way They Were">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./diablo-4-world-boss-timer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diablo 4 World Boss timer | What do we know about UK spawn times?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
