At the time of this writing, no charges have been filed against him.</p><p>However, along with Bobby, his parents are also taking the heat on social media. Learn about Robert Crimo’s parents Bob Crimo and Denise Pesina here. This article covers everything from their age, job, and current residence. So, keep scrolling down to learn more about his parents in this article.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Highland Park Suspected Shooter Robert Crimo III Family Members?</strong></h3><p>Robert Crimo III belonged to a family of five. In his family, he has his parents Robert “Bob” Crimo Jr, his mother Denise Pesina, and his two siblings. Bobby AKA “Awaken The Rapper” and his siblings appears to be the fourth generation resident of Highland Park, Illinois.</p><p>Learn more about his family in this article below.</p><h3><strong>Meet Highland Park Suspected Shooter Robert Crimo III Father, Robert “Bob” Crimo Jr.</strong></h3><p>Robert Crimo Jr. or Bob Crimo was born to his parents Robert “Bob” Crimo Sr. and Christine Crimo (nee Caldarelli). In July 2022 at the time of this writing, Bob is 58 years old.</p><p>Bob has a sister named Rosanne Crimo. She is currently married to Jeff Wygodny and they are currently based in Chicago, Illinois. Jeff and Rosanne are parents to two children Lila and Jemma Wygodny.</p><p>Bob’s father died on 26 October 2018 and his mother died in January 2010 at the age of 72.</p><p>Talking about the profession, Robert Crimo Jr owned <a href=#>Bob’s Pantry and Deli Inc</a>. Being a people person, he places a high value on interpersonal relationships and running this business allowed him to do both while offering Highland Park and the nearby communities a special service.</p><p>In addition, Bob added that Highland park provided “a safe, clean and supportive environment for family-oriented businesses to operate”. So, he ended up starting Bob’s Pantry and Deli Inc.</p><p>Back in 2013, he was interviewed by ChicagoTribune. Talking about his business, Bob shared, “The biggest draw to the store is the deli. Fresh meats, cheeses, and garnishes make our custom-made sandwiches a No. 1 seller. We also offer a wide variety of grocery, dairy items, and ice cream novelties”.</p><p>Bob added that his store offered a place not only for great food but great conversation as well in our seating area. He said, “This is a unique facet that you cannot find anywhere else but in a family-run and family-oriented store”.</p><p>Additionally, Bob ran the White Hen Pantry in Ravinia for more than 18 years before Seven-Eleven acquired it in 2007. He was thus left without a store and a job. He has spent 39 years working in the industry overall.</p><p>However, Bob removed his LinkedIn, which makes it harder to find information about his career. He unsuccessfully sought the position of mayor back in 2019. The city’s current mayor, Nancy Rotering, a Democrat, who ran on a platform supporting gun control, beat out the man who identified as “a person for the people,” according to the Independent.</p><h3><strong>Meet Highland Park Suspected Shooter Robert Crimo III Mother, Denise Pesina</strong></h3><p>Several online sources revealed Denise Crimo (nee Pesina), mother of Robert Crimo III, is a Mormon.

According to her LinkedIn, she works at Trilogy Energy Systems as a Holistic Health Practitioner. Besides that, she supports her husband to run the family business.</p><p>While Denise’s political affiliation remains unclear her husband Bob is a supporter of Trump.</p><p>According to New York Post, Robert Crimo III’s father Bob Crimo or Robert Crimo Jr. liked a tweet supporting the Second Amendment just days after the Uvalde school massacre. The tweet reportedly read, “Protect the Second Amendment like your life depends on it”.</p><p>The tweet came just days after a shooter made his way into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and killed 19 children and two teachers on May 24. On his Twitter account, Bobby Crimo also shared a photo of himself wearing a Trump flag as a cape.</p><p><strong>Did You Know:</strong> Denise is related to martial artist Daniel Pesina known for Mortal Kombat video games as characters such as Johhny Cage, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Reptile, and Smoke.</p><h3><strong>Does Highland Park Suspected Shooter Robert Crimo III Have Siblings?</strong></h3><p>Robert Crimo III is the middle child born to his parents.
