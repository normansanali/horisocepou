My. Gawd. It’s Chandler’s birthday! That’s right! The hilariously sarcastic <a href=#>Friends</a> character Chandler Bing’s (<a href=#>Matthew Perry</a>) birthday is April 8. This year, he turns 55 years old, which is truly unbelievable. In our minds, Chandler is still in Westchester with Monica (<a href=#>Courteney Cox</a>) running an advertising agency while his kids, Jack and Erica, are off to college. But Chandler had several relationships before he and Monica realized that they were each other’s lobsters.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So in honor of Chandler’s birthday, we want to commemorate all of <a href=#>Chandler’s hilarious ex-girlfriends in Friends</a>, from one-night stands and sticky situations to the most memorable of them all. Here’s a list of Chandler Bing’s relationships, from his earliest camp girlfriend to Monica.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Janice Litman-Goralnik starting in Season 1, Episode 5, “The One With the East German Laundry Detergent”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Chandler’s girlfriend Janice Litman-Goralnik (Maggie Wheeler) was the first girlfriend we meet on the show in the hilarious episode when Chandler attempts to break up with Janice. Janice and Chandler later had one of the most iconic breakups in the series when Janice is fine with it because she knows they’ll end up back together (she’s not wrong).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=#>Distractify</a> actually spoke with Maggie about her time on the show. Maggie shared, “[Janice] just showed up in her skin the way she was and everybody else just had to adjust. … I love that she was so true to herself. And yeah, I think we could all take a page out of her book and just be our authentic selves in the face of the world.” When in doubt, be like Janice!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Aurora in Season 1, Episode 6, “The One With the Butt”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Chandler meets Aurora (Sofia Milos), a beautiful Israeli woman, and asks her on a date. While on the date, he learns that Aurora already has a husband … and a boyfriend.

However, when Chandler’s boss instructs him to fire Nina, he’s clearly at odds. So to get out of it, he tells his boss that Nina is “crazy” — of course, Nina finds out and ends their relationship herself, solving Chandler’s problems.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Danielle in Season 1, Episode 20, “The One With the Evil Orthodontist”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After a date with a great girl, Chandler gets hung up on how to call her back. He obsesses over checking his voicemail and leaving her the perfect voicemail to the point that he accidentally turns off his phone. Danielle (Lynn Clark) shows up at Central Perk to check on Chandler, but because she does that, Chandler loses interest because she’s “too needy.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jade in Season 2, Episode 5, “The One With Five Steaks and an Eggplant”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Chandler’s first foray into Season 2 dating is in a somewhat questionable scenario. A woman named Jade (Brittney Powell) accidentally calls Chander’s apartment with the wrong number, looking for Bob.</p><p>Chandler pretends to be Bob, schedules a date with Jade, and then consoles her as himself when Bob doesn’t show up. But Chandler gets his comeuppance — he learns that Jade is unimpressed with his “moves.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Susie “Underpants” in Season 2, Episode 13, “The One After the Super Bowl, Pt. 2”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It's clear by now that Chandler is not too kind to the women he dates. He goes after Susie (<a href=#>Julia Roberts</a>), who is somehow mutually interested in Chandler. But her interest is all a ruse. She reveals that she is actually Susie “Underpants,” a girl Chandler pantsed in elementary school. Susie gets back at Chandler by leaving him in women’s underpants, alone in a public men’s room. That’ll show him!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mary-Angela in Season 3, Episode 11, “The One Where Chandler Can’t Remember Which Sister”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Between Susie and Mary-Angela Tribbiani (Holly Gagnier), Chandler dates Janice. While getting over Janice, Chandler gets black-out drunk and makes out with one of Joey’s seven sisters, but he can’t remember which sister. Even when he learns that the sister's name is Mary-Angela, Chandler doesn’t recognize her. Chandler gets a deserved punch in the face from Joey’s other sister, Cookie.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ginger in Season 3, Episode 14, “The One With Phoebe’s Ex-Partner”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Moving on, Chandler asks out Ginger (Sherilyn Fenn), a beautiful woman he meets at the coffee shop. But when he learns that she has a wooden leg, he forces himself not to let it bother him.
