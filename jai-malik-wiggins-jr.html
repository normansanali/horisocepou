He is just enjoying his childhood as any kid would.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/2/2/327948976_186516430677120_7580448367455466922_n%20(1)-1675324115637.jpg><p>Even Jai's mom hardly posts about him on her social media, which suggests that she just wants to give him a normal childhood.

Both of them ended their relationship in <strong>June 2015</strong>. The two first started dating in <strong>May 2010</strong>. These two never tied the knot but shared the responsibility of being a parent because of Jai Jr.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/2/2/Screenshot_20230202_133646%20(1)-1675324355137.jpg><p>Yung and Jai had first crossed paths at a friend's party in Miami. Their relationship didn't go as they would have liked, and it was even worse as their relationship ended awfully, particularly of all the things Jai Jr.'s father did.</p><p>But despite all that, Yung still had feelings for her. She was filming the music video for her song, <i>P**** Talk</i>,<i> </i>when the shooting incident involving Wiggins happened. She was devastated and cried a lot when she found out about it. The rapper also shared a heartfelt tribute to Wiggins through a post on Instagram.</p><h2>Jai Jr.'s Father Died Protecting His Sister</h2><p>Jai Jr. lost his father, Jai Wiggins while undergoing treatment for his injuries on<strong> June 15, 2020</strong>, following a tragic shooting incident.

But, it is known that Wiggins lost his life while trying to protect his <strong>sister</strong>. Jai Jr. was only six years old when he lost his father.&nbsp;</p><h2>Has A Sister: Who Is Yung Miami Daughter?</h2><p>Jai Jr. is not the only kid of the rapper Yung Miami as she also has a daughter named <strong>Summer Miami Luellen</strong>. She isn't his biological sister, as her father is Southside. The famous producer, Southside, is no longer in a relationship with the<i> Ex For A Reason</i> singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/2/2/261377842_131172899311324_4366455711853301997_n%20(1)-1675324665566.jpg><p>Summer was only born on <strong>October 18, 2019</strong>, making her only three years old. But she is already a star. Not just because of her famous parents but she is an Internet star too with her super popular Instagram page <a href=# rel=nofollow>@thelifeofsummermiami</a>. It remains to be known if it's Yung Miami who runs the account or if she has someone else hired for it.</p><h2>Jai Jr.'s Father Was Abusive Towards His Mother</h2><p>Jai Jr.'s Mother, Yung Miami, was the victim of domestic violence as his father, Wiggins, would abuse the <i>Gotta Move On</i> singer a lot. And the abuse happened on more than one occasion. The abuse is also the reason she gave up on this relationship.</p><p>Wiggins almost also went to jail because of it. He had disobeyed the order from the court. He had been ordered by the court to take on parenting and domestic violence classes. This had come after <i>Take Yo Man </i>singer Yung Miami had filed a restraining order against him.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Blast</i></a>, in their article, has reported that Yung Miami alleged that she was stalked and harassed by Jai Jr.'s father.

By profession, she is a rapper from Miami. She has been making quite a name for herself in the rap game and has worked with artists like Quavo and Bryson Tiller.</p><p>Miami's&nbsp;solo rap career has been remarkable, but she is also a member of the group City Girls.

The rapper has also given music to films like <i>Bad Boys For Life </i>and<i> Bruised.</i></p><h2>Is Jai Jr.'s Mother Homophobic And Racist?</h2><p>Yung Miami was the talk of the media for all the wrong reasons for one of her comments. The comment she made was considered to be homophobic. She had said that she wouldn't want her son to be gay, which, as expected, didn't go down well with many people.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Act Up </i>singer Yung had said that if she finds her son, Jai Malik Wiggins Jr., gay, she would beat him up. This wasn't the first time she had said something like this. <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Billboard</i></a> has reported that her previous tweet was also about the same thing.</p><p>Not just homophobic, but Jai Jr.'s mother has also been accused of being a racist in the past. It happened for her comments about the people of Haiti.
