Ben Lagow was only just beginning to make an impactful mark at Hampden Sydney with his dedication and passion on the lacrosse field when tragedy struck and took his life unexpectedly. His passing leaves an irreparable gap both within Hampden Sydney College itself as well as among family, friends, and anyone who had an opportunity to witness his amazing talent first-hand.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Was Ben Lagow?</h2><p>Ben Lagow was a rising freshman student at Hampden-Sydney College who quickly distinguished himself in college sports arena. A graduate from Norfolk Academy in Norfolk, Virginia, Ben had already made waves during his high school athletic years by excelling at soccer, swimming and lacrosse among many other activities – earning himself admiration from colleagues for both his admirable work ethic and extraordinary set of talents.</p><p>Ben was recognized in both soccer and lacrosse with significant accomplishments. For soccer, his athletic ability and determination earned him recognition on the TCIS (Tidewater Conference of Independent Schools). On lacrosse he received honors of First-Team All-Prep League and All-TCIS recognitions; additionally he achieved Second-Team All-State status and gained national recognition as an accomplished top player.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened to Ben Lagow?</h2><p>Ben Lagow’s untimely death on December 26, 2023 in Virginia Beach, Virginia came as a great shock. At just 20 years old, his circumstances of his passing left many reeling in shock and sadness; reports state that Ben succumbed to an asthma attack as the cause – another tragic and unexpected turn of events which underscores life’s unpredictability.</p><p>As a tribute to Ben, Ohef Sholom Temple in Norfolk will host a memorial service on December 31st in his honor, giving those who knew and respected him an opportunity to reunite and remember their memories as well as provide support during such an emotionally trying time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Ben Lagow Die?</h2><p>Ben Lagow died unexpectedly due to an asthma attack, highlighting its fragility. While asthma is now better understood as manageable condition, its risk is still present and his death serves as a somber reminder of how life can unexpectedly take an unexpected turn, leaving a profound imprint on those left behind.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Remembering Ben Lagow</h3><p>Ben’s memory will forever remain in the hearts of his family – Chris and Jen Lagow, his sister Cate, and brother Max all mourn his absence keenly; especially those involved with sports; his mother was an accomplished soccer player at Skidmore College which may have inspired Ben’s interest in lacrosse as an activity.</p><p>Ben was an ambitious student majoring in Business. In addition to academic pursuits, he balanced them with recreational pursuits including TV shows like Breaking Bad and movies such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. An avid sports fanatic himself, Ben supported teams like New England Patriots, Boston Celtics and Red Sox avidly while admiring professional athletes like Jayson Tatum and Grant Williams as fans and sports enthusiasts.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Legacy of Ben Lagow</h3><p>Ben Lagow left an incredible legacy beyond sports and academic achievements. His passion, dedication, and impactful influence are true indicators of his significance in society – the grief felt by Hampden Sydney College community members, family, and friends is testament to how integrally important he was in their lives.</p><p>Ben’s story serves as an inspiring reminder of the value and necessity of cherishing every moment in life. When the community gathers to commemorate his life and honor him, they reinforce a message about resilience and strengthening human connections against adversity. Ben will continue to inspire those he knew as well as provide guidance and leadership to future generations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZH51f5hpZpudnmK5orPOsGSompmpwqK%2B2GauoaddrK60ecGepWakkZy8uHnWoZitZZiWvbGxzZ6bZqyfYq%2BmuoylmKCnp2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fben-lagow-obituary-who-was-ben-lagow-what-happened-to-ben-lagow.html&text=Ben%20Lagow%20Obituary%20Who%20Was%20Ben%20Lagow%3f%20What%20Happened%20To%20Ben%20Lagow%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fben-lagow-obituary-who-was-ben-lagow-what-happened-to-ben-lagow.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fben-lagow-obituary-who-was-ben-lagow-what-happened-to-ben-lagow.html&title=Ben%20Lagow%20Obituary%20Who%20Was%20Ben%20Lagow%3f%20What%20Happened%20To%20Ben%20Lagow%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fben-lagow-obituary-who-was-ben-lagow-what-happened-to-ben-lagow.html&title=Ben%20Lagow%20Obituary%20Who%20Was%20Ben%20Lagow%3f%20What%20Happened%20To%20Ben%20Lagow%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fben-lagow-obituary-who-was-ben-lagow-what-happened-to-ben-lagow.html&title=Ben%20Lagow%20Obituary%20Who%20Was%20Ben%20Lagow%3f%20What%20Happened%20To%20Ben%20Lagow%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fben-lagow-obituary-who-was-ben-lagow-what-happened-to-ben-lagow.html&description=Ben%20Lagow%20Obituary%20Who%20Was%20Ben%20Lagow%3f%20What%20Happened%20To%20Ben%20Lagow%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ben-lamb.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Lamb">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lyrics-audtin-and-ally.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Audtin and ally lyrics">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
