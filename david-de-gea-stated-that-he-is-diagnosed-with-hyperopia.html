David has hyperopia, commonly known as farsightedness, an eye condition in which a person can see objects well from a distance but has trouble seeing items that are closer to them.&nbsp;Despite having this issue, he seldom wears glasses and prefers contact lenses. He also uses contact lenses during matches.</p><h2>David did not begin his career as a goalie because he was too young</h2><p>He played as a midfielder and, at times, in every position, including defense and attack, although he became incredibly tall over time.&nbsp;He was 6 feet 4 inches tall, which made it difficult for him to sprint swiftly.&nbsp;He began to struggle in matches, which is when he chose to become a goalie and excelled at it.&nbsp;He utilized his height to his advantage in goalkeeping.&nbsp;Parental support: David had strong parental support from an early age. His father was a professional goalie as well.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/David-de-Gea-3.jpg alt="David de Gea" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He used to be a Getafe goalie and was also David’s finest coach since he was highly tough and coached him effectively.&nbsp;David’s mother was a homemaker who always wanted her kid to have a good mix of academics and athletics.&nbsp;They would go 50 kilometers only to watch their kid practice at the Atletico. They were constantly supportive of their kid and made sure he performed his best.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>David de Gea</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Football player</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqlsYygnJplo6mutbHDZquhmaRitaZ5yKxknaGRnLuwv8SdZLChpJ16qcXPnqmoqJmWfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-de-gea-stated-that-he-is-diagnosed-with-hyperopia.html&text=David%20de%20Gea%20Stated%20That%20He%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Hyperopia&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-de-gea-stated-that-he-is-diagnosed-with-hyperopia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-de-gea-stated-that-he-is-diagnosed-with-hyperopia.html&title=David%20de%20Gea%20Stated%20That%20He%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Hyperopia" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-de-gea-stated-that-he-is-diagnosed-with-hyperopia.html&title=David%20de%20Gea%20Stated%20That%20He%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Hyperopia" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-de-gea-stated-that-he-is-diagnosed-with-hyperopia.html&title=David%20de%20Gea%20Stated%20That%20He%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Hyperopia" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-de-gea-stated-that-he-is-diagnosed-with-hyperopia.html&description=David%20de%20Gea%20Stated%20That%20He%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Hyperopia" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./first-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-reactions-hint-james-gunn-has-saved-the-mcu-before-bidding-farewell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="First Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 reactions hint James Gunn has saved the MCU before biddin">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bay-area-buggs-net-worth-129487.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bay Area Buggs Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
