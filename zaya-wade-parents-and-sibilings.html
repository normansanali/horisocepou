Dwayne, her father, is one of the greatest basketball players of all time, having won three titles in the National Basketball Association.</strong></p><p>This is all the information you need to know about Zaya, the daughter of an NBA player, including her early years, education, experience as a transgender adolescent, family, and relationships. Let’s get started.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_Zaya_Wade8217s_Age_Has_She_Been_Adopted>What Is Zaya Wade’s Age? Has She Been Adopted?</span></h2><p>On May 29, 2007, Zaya was born in Illinois, USA. She will be 15 years old in 2022. Zion Malachi Airamis Wade was her birth name. Zaya was raised as her parents’ boy until 2019, at which point she came out as a transgender adolescent.</p><p>Contrary to what is being said, she is the biological child of Siohvaughn Funches and Dwyane Wade, not an adopted child.</p><p>Regarding her education, Zaya continues to attend Sierra Canyon School as a student. She is more interested in extracurricular activities like dance and singing than in academics.</p><p>In addition, she is an American citizen and an Afro-American ethnicity member.</p><h2><span id=The_Parent-Child_Relationship_of_Zaya_Wade_A_High_School_Love_Story>The Parent-Child Relationship of Zaya Wade: A High School Love Story</span></h2><p>Dwyane and Siohvaughn, Zaya’s parents, dated while they were still in high school. Her mother was only fifteen years old at the time. Following his graduation from high school, Siohvaughn moved into Dwyane’s apartment, where they welcomed their first child on February 4, 2002.</p><p>On May 18, 2002, they eventually got married after having their kid. As the years went by, the couple was blessed with another son on May 29, 2007, giving them another joyous occasion to celebrate as parents.</p><p>That joy, nevertheless, didn’t last long because they decided to split up that same year. In 2010, the court granted Dwyane Wade custody of both of the children following Wade’s divorce from his former spouse.</p><h2><span id=Zaya_Wade_is_a_sibling_of_how_many>Zaya Wade is a sibling of how many?</span></h2><p>Through her father’s connections, Zaya has three siblings in total: Zaire Wade, Xavier Zechariah Wade, and Kaavia James Union Wade.</p><p>Zaya’s biological brother is Zaire Wade. His birthday is February 4, 2002. Like his father Dwyane, he plays professional basketball in the United States.</p><p>In addition, Zaya’s father’s relationship with his long-term girlfriend Aja Metoyer produced her half-brother, Xavier. Xavier is only eight years old as of right now, having been born in 2013. She also has Kaaviya, her half-sister from her father’s second marriage. On November 7, 2018, she was born via surrogacy.</p><h2><span id=Gender_Identity_Zaya_Wade_Is_A_Member_Of_The_LGBTQIA_Community>Gender Identity: Zaya Wade Is A Member Of The LGBTQIA Community</span></h2><p>Zaya came out as a transgender woman in 2020. Her father, Dwyane, stated in a special interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show</p><p>Our 12-year-old daughter Zaya, whose real name was Zion when he was born, said, “Hey, so I want to talk to you guys,” when she got home. I’m not sure if everyone is aware of this. I believe I’m prepared to live authentically moving forward. I would also like to be referred to as her and her. Please feel free to refer to me as Zaya.</p><p>In this sense, Zaya has shared candidly about her experiences as a transgender adolescent. Zaya claims that she received a lot of backlash for choosing to identify as transgender. She stated in an exclusive interview with Logo</p><p>“There are real individuals out there that believe you’re just a child, that this is just a phase, or that you have no idea what you’re talking about.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite everything, Dwyane’s transgender daughter is content and self-assured. Let us examine her words.</p><p>“I feel free when I am being who I truly am. It feels so liberating, to be honest and transparent with both myself and other people about who I am. It’s a lovely sensation to possess, hold, and be able to spread to everyone.</p><h2><span id=Is_Pride_Month_Celebrated_in_Zaya>Is Pride Month Celebrated in Zaya?</span></h2><p>Zaya is a member of the LGBTQIA, but she doesn’t want to observe Pride Month. She has previously stated, according to her father Dwyane, that she will not observe pride months in the same manner as other people. A trans youngster wants to support LGBTQIA families more than anything else.</p><h2><span id=Zaya8217s_greatest_supporters_are_her_parents>Zaya’s greatest supporters are her parents.</span></h2><p>There is a person on the planet who is there for them through good times and bad. In the same way, Zaya’s father Dwyane, and stepmother Gabrielle Union are two of her strongest allies.</p><p>Zaya received complete support from her parents for every action she made. Her stepmother and her adored father were there to support her as she made her public debut as a transgender adolescent. When her life took a major shift, they both encouraged her to introduce herself as Zaya in their accounts. Dwayne, her father, wrote,</p><p>“Let her reintroduce herself, everyone. Her name is Zaya Wade! She has become one of the LGBTQ+ community’s youthful faces and voices.</p><p>Union, her father’s current spouse at the time of her transition, also wrote,</p><p>“Meet Zaya. She is incredibly smart, loving, and compassionate, and we are very proud of her.” It’s acceptable to accept, love, and listen to your kids for who they are. Kindly light and love the wonderful folks.</p><p>Similarly, Zaya received excellent counsel from both of her guardians on numerous occasions. They have supported her resolutely in every circumstance, from dealing with criticism to upholding beauty standards.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_Zaya_Wade8217s_Daily_Work_Her_Professional_Life>What Is Zaya Wade’s Daily Work? Her Professional Life</span></h2><p>She has not selected a professional job and is still a student, as was previously stated. But judging from her Instagram accounts, it appears that a transgender teenager has begun CHANEL BEAUTY modeling. We are unable to confirm anything, though, as she has not made any official remarks about it.</p><h2><span id=Is_Zaya_Wade_seeing_a_boyfriend_What_is_her_relationship_status>Is Zaya Wade seeing a boyfriend? What is her relationship status?</span></h2><p>Even at such a young age, Zaya is more confident in who she is and dares to go it alone in life. This also applies to her romantic status. At the Easter celebration that her family is hosting, she is currently spotted lip-locking with a youngster named Hudson who is also thought to be transgender.</p><p>On his Instagram, Hudson shared a post about their collaboration with the message, “Passover and Easter have never been more fun, I Love You 💙♾ #zayawade.”</p><p>It follows that Zaya is presumably dating Hudson @HuazeLeo at the moment and isn’t afraid to introduce her partner. I hope their love affair lasts.</p><h2><span id=Wade8217s_Online_Persona_Does_She_Use_Instagram>Wade’s Online Persona: Does She Use Instagram?</span></h2><p>Now let’s talk about Zaya’s online persona. She uses the account @zayawade on Instagram and is quite active there. She has 547k Instagram followers and has shared 166 posts thus far.</p><p>Moreover, Dwyane’s daughter uses Facebook as well. Additionally, she goes as @ZayaWade2 on Twitter, where she has 59 followers.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_The_Net_Worth_of_Zaya_Wade>What Is The Net Worth of Zaya Wade?</span></h2><p>She is a student, as we have stated. Zaya might therefore have the leisure to create her sources of income. She is still debatable even if some publications peg her net worth at $1,035,000.</p><p>Her well-known father, Dwyane, on the other hand, is worth $170 million.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also, Read, Jonathan Gillibrand, Faizon Love, and Manual Dallori."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":12,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":31}{"1":33,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":64}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":12,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-gillibrand/"}{"1":31}{"1":33,"2":"https://popularbio.com/faizon-love/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://popularbio.com/manuel-dallori/"}{"1":64}'>Also, Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Gillibrand</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Faizon Love</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Manual Dallori</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity kid</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Ryan Clark Accident, What Happened To Him, His Medical Condition</a></h3>Clark is a former American football safety who played safety.
