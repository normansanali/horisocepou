Her daughter Raven is a prominent actress active in the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Gaulden is not involved in the showbiz industry like her daughter Raven working in TV series and movies. She was professionally involved in the It Field. National Cash Register is a software company where she has previously worked in.</p><h2>Early Life And Education Details &nbsp;</h2><p>Lydia Glauden was born in 1958 in Winnfield, Louisiana. Her father is Louise Moss but she has not revealed her mother's identity in any media. Unfortunately, both of her parents are not alive as of now.</p><p>Regarding education, Lydia graduated from Winnfield High School in 1976. For her Bachelor's degree, she enrolled at Southern University specializing in Computer Science.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after finishing her education, Lydia started to work in the IT field. However, after some, she then relocated to Atlanta, Georgia where she worked for National Cash Register. &nbsp;</p><h2>Know About The Married Life Of Gaulden</h2><p>Lydia Gaulden is the wife of <strong>Christopher Pearman</strong> with whom she has shared the marital life. Her husband is an author. Besides that, he has also worked in the entertainment sector making several music videos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/1/from-left-Blaize-Peramans-father-Christopher-B-Pearman-his-sister-Raven-Symeon-and-his-mother-Lydia-Gaulden.%20(1)%20(2)-1677660548033.jpg><p>Gaulden and Pearman had their first meeting in Atlanta, Georgia in the early 80s. At that time, she was working as a System Analyst whereas Chris was a PR for the nightclub industry. They have said that they barely met each other due to work pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>Raven Symone's parents Lyida and Christopher managed to maintain their relationship despite the difficulties. They stepped further into their romantic life after completing the marriage ceremony in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h3>Details Of Lydia and Christopher's Kids</h3><p>The romantic duo Gaulden and Pearman welcomed two kids from their romantic married life. Both experienced the role of fatherhood & motherhood by raising two kids Raven Symone and Blaize Pearman.&nbsp;</p><p>Gaulden welcomed her first daughter <strong>Raven </strong>into this world on<i> </i>December 10, 1985, in Atlanta, Georgia. She was born soon after one year of her parent's marriage. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/1/Capture%20(1)-1677665963259.jpg><p>Likewise, Lydia added one more beautiful chapter to her family by giving birth to Blaize Pearman. Raven Symone's younger brother Blaize was born on <strong>December 17, 1991</strong>, in Ossining, New York.</p><p>As of now, Blaize isn't active in the entertainment industry like his elder sister Raven. In addition, he has not revealed his actual profession in any media.&nbsp;</p><h2>Are Lydia Gaulden And Pearman Together Or Separated?&nbsp;</h2><p>There have always been rumors circulating whether the duo Glauden and Pearman have split or shared their longstanding marriage. However, it cannot be confirmed what bond they hold for now.&nbsp;</p><p>The absence of Lydia on social networking sites narrows down the information sources to know about her relationship status. As of now, not a single Internet site has placed information regarding this topic.&nbsp;</p><p>On Christopher's Facebook handle, he has shared several other pictures but not a single one with his wife. No post regarding Lydia has made people curious about the topic.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there can be made random speculations regarding Pearman and Glauden's separation. Nothing can be confirmed about it until both parties show up and talk about the matter of their divorce.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Rich Is Lydia Glauden?</h2><p>Lydia Gaulden's net worth details are still behind the curtains. It is because the round figure of her net worth is not placed on any Internet sites.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Lydia, her daughter is a millionaire. Raven Symone has a net worth of <strong>$55 million </strong>similar to<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Maria Bird</strong></a>. She has amassed this hefty money from her successful career in music and acting career.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/1/ravensymone_309179990_611768677289181_4161819933297773778_n%20(1)-1677666932038.jpg><p>Symone music albums include <i>Undeniable</i>, <i>This Is My Time</i> and <i>From Then Until</i>. She generates money from digital platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer. She has over <strong>1 million</strong> monthly listeners and millions of streams of her songs on Spotify.&nbsp;</p><p>As of now, Raven has one upcoming project <i>Quarter </i>where she will be playing the role of Dr. Andreson. This project will definitely help to rise her income.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lydia Gaulden's Daughter's Assets and Real Estate</h2><p>The <i>Empire </i>actress <a href=# rel=nofollow>Symone purchased a 4,000-square-foot home</a> in Sherman Oaks, California for <strong>$1.4 million</strong> in 2009. In November 2020, she kept the house for sale with an asking price of $2.1 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/1/RSymone_SO2-1677666533169.jpg><p>Raven-Symoné owns several other properties, including a villa in Atlanta, a mansion in Beverly Hills, and an apartment in New York. She also reportedly owns a few more properties, although details about them are not currently available.</p><p><i>Glauden's&nbsp;</i>daughter Raven loves to live lavish and luxurious life from the money she has earned. She owns luxury cars like Porsche Cayenne Turbo, Chevrolet Camaro GT, Mercedes Maybach, and a few more in the collections.</p><h2>A Glance At Lydia's Husband's Life</h2><p>Christopher Pearman is an African-American who graduated from Georgia State University. He has a degree in political science and criminal justice. In the 80s, he worked in PR and advertising for several nightclubs in Atlanta.</p><p>It's quite surprising but Lydia's spouse Pearman is an author who has published several books like <a href=#><strong>Nina Easton</strong></a>. His author credits include <i>Dream So Big: A Parent’s Guide To Helping Your Child Believe And Achieve.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/1/Screenshot%202023-03-01%20144020-min-1677661000956.jpg><p>More importantly, Pearman has been certified by the National Academy Of Sports Medicine as a physical trainer. He has specialized in the department of health and wellness</p><p>Similarly, Pearman is a versatile individual who has also made significant contributions to the entertainment industry. Besides the author, he is a successful director and producer. He has also directed a hit musical called <i>Destiny of Rose</i>.</p><h2>An Outlook &nbsp;At Lydia's Daughter's Career In Entertainment Industry</h2><p>Raven Symone has been active in the entertainment industry for over three decades playing in TV series and movies.
