While plenty of great movies have situated themselves among con men and robbers, and luxuriated in the satisfaction of a good grift, not as many take the time to take us through the play-by-play of a heist — whether its a mere bank stickup or something requiring more time and planning and laser-dodging acrobatics. And you need only see one movie that <a href=#>thinks it can get away with hand-waving its entire heist</a> to recognize how rewarding it is when a filmmaker actually takes its time to show how the whole crime sausage is made.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z22zc000y3g64cthwftaa@published data-word-count=116>What follows is an extremely scientific grading of some of the best and most memorable heist-movie heists, graded not for cinematic quality, but on the strength of the execution of the people doing the heist. My criteria include Finesse and Planning (how detail-oriented our crew is, and the degree to which they’ve thought of everything, as well as physical grace) and Style (aesthetic elements such as wardrobe and props, as well as more immaterial qualities like charisma and team chemistry). Weighed less in the grading but still crucial are the stakes of the mission, and how much collateral damage is accrued (the less, the higher the score — in this house, we like a clean heist!).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z24zx005w3g646lixeudo@published data-word-count=79>And, of course, we’ll be grading the actual success of the heist — not only if our heroes get the money/gold/diamonds, in the short term, but whether or not it measurably improves their lives. You may be as surprised by the results as I was — a couple of scenes I assumed were classics come up short, and a bunch of surfer goons pull off what, for my money, is one of the slickest bank robberies in contemporary cinema.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z231i00103g64zsy7nibz@published data-word-count=7><strong>12.

But for this racetrack in the 1950s, career criminal Johnny Clay has just about all of his bases covered. Everything seems to be obscured through layers of plausible deniability, from Maurice’s fake-out fight at the bar, to the gun Johnny eventually uses to stick up the attendants in the money room. A good 90 percent of the energy of this heist is distraction, which is why it’s still fun to watch unfold. The only thing that seems grossly negligent is sharpshooter Nikki’s getaway plan after shooting the racehorse in broad daylight — and he takes the hit for that negligence.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z234100183g64wa372tj0@published data-word-count=54><strong>Style: 8/25</strong><br>The whole point of The Killing’s premise is, “What if four average-joe, noncriminal, middle-class schlubs pulled off the most meticulous heist of the year?” So naturally, this is not the most inspiring bunch — a cashier, a bartender, a cop, all with faces that look like they’ve done their share of worried scowling.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z235a001a3g641nusbnwv@published data-word-count=64><strong>Stakes: 10/15</strong><br>They aren’t necessarily all life-and-death matters, but everyone involved has a reason for being in on Joe’s plan: bills to pay, sickly wives to take care of, evil wives to placate. Poor George is particularly feeling the crunch — little does he know that even if he does pull off the heist, his deliciously over-it wife Sherry is still going to leave him.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z235f001b3g64e4ottb2e@published data-word-count=105><strong>Lack of Collateral Damage: 7/15</strong><br>There’s a lot of human bloodshed on this list, and yet somehow the shooting death of racehorse Red Lightning feels like one of the more gnarly ones here. Nikki, the horse’s shooter, also doesn’t last long, perhaps divine retribution for his crime (and for being shown to be a racist toad in the final moments of his life). Sherry’s sidepiece Val, while trying to hijack the gang after the heist, catches a bullet from George. Some security guards probably take some bruises during the pandemonium around Maurice’s fight. All in all, things devolve pretty quickly after the masterfully executed robbery itself.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z2368001d3g647cl2sjya@published data-word-count=108><strong>Success: 0/20</strong><br>You’ll see a theme among the heist films of classic Hollywood (and France, and Britain), which is that criminals will rarely be shown to be successful or gratified by their crimes. No matter how brilliant and calculating the crew is, karma will find its way back to them before they’ve had a chance to truly enjoy the spoils of their efforts. The Killing is no different, but there’s something especially dispiriting about the penultimate scene, in which the suitcase full of money is knocked off onto the airport runway due to a runaway miniature poodle, and all the 2 million goes flying like confetti across the tarmac.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z2368001e3g64k7bv06mm@published data-word-count=3><strong>Final Score: 46/100</strong></p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z2385001g3g64rkhlkgyt@published data-word-count=9><strong>11.

The bank robberies of Set It Off really are smash and grab — the team cases one bank, but then mostly relies on former teller Frankie’s general knowledge of banks to wing their way through the other robberies. The pièce de résistance in their audacious second outing is Queen Latifah’s Cleo, charging her stolen Suburban through the glass window of the bank into a tower of promotional teddy bears while the cops stand right out on the sidewalk, backing into the wall into some kind of tropical-themed grill next door, and then driving out through a different window back out onto Wilshire. Smooth.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z23ak001m3g64b4y8igqv@published data-word-count=85><strong>Style: 15/25</strong><br>This is only the ladies’ second bank robbery, but they’ve already tidied up nicely since their first outing — they’ve certainly upgraded their wig game, at least. But otherwise, their looks are all over the place — Stony’s the most unobtrusive in a black hoodie, T.T. is wearing a flannel I’m pretty sure I had in 1996, and Frankie’s rocking a quasi-mod jacket and crop-top set. They’ll get a unified look going for their final robbery, but this is still a work in progress.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z23b9001o3g64xixdvc2j@published data-word-count=89><strong>Stakes: 15/15</strong><br>The film spends a lot of time making sure that we believe why these four South L.A. women would resort to violent crime (except for Cleo, who apparently just wants to work on her car and buy nice clothes for her girlfriend — certainly understandable!). They’re all at dead ends — Frankie’s lost her job, T.T.’s son has been taken by CPS, and the police shooting of Stony’s college-bound brother makes the issue of whether or not to stay poor and stay in the projects a life-or-death issue.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z23bv001p3g644qa9ybff@published data-word-count=33><strong>Lack of Collateral Damage: 9/15</strong><strong><br></strong>Miraculously, nobody gets hurt that we see — though someone should check on that grill cook.

But each of those cuts is so deliberate and planned-to-the-millisecond that it feels a lot more graceful than that. The one bit of pre-robbery planning we really get in-depth with is their handling of the store’s security system; by buying a duplicate, they’re able to figure out what exactly they can get away with before they trip the alarm. (In the end, they just shut it up with what appears to be some kind of spray insulation.) Overall, this is a masterfully executed heist, though I will dock one point for leaving the store such a mess — the longer it takes for the store to realize it’s been robbed, the more lead time you get!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z23gg00213g642cn06tui@published data-word-count=92><strong>Style: 24/25</strong><br>Tony’s crew has plenty of personality, particularly the safe breaker César (played by director Jules Dassin), and they work together like clockwork. They show up to the robbery looking as dapper as a bunch of rough-n’-tumble jewel thieves can, dropping into Mappin & Webb in their suits and ties. The black umbrella — which catches the debris as the group tunnel down from the upstairs apartment — is an unforgettable flourish. If only Tony himself wasn’t such a piece of shit, they might be easier to root for … see below.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z23hk00233g641kjwwr95@published data-word-count=99><strong>Stakes: 2/15</strong><br>Tony is one of countless just-out-of-prison career criminals looking for their next score, but he’s wary at first of ripping off the jewelry store. He changes his tune once he realizes that his old girl Mado (Marie Sabouret) has shacked up with a well-heeled gangster in his absence. After beating her up for her lack of faithfulness (bonjour, 1950s!), he’s suddenly all-in — so we can only conclude that his motivation for the robbery is … to win back the girl … he gave a black eye to?

The joint — in this case a bustling piazza in Turin — had already been studiously cased. Somewhat ironically, the part of the heist that takes place in the square has the least finesse — all fisticuffs and water cannons in the middle of a crowd in broad daylight. Most of the finesse that Croker & Co. bring to the game is the getaway, a complicated maze of back alleys and sewer tunnels and cars inside cars, which is pulled off more or less capably.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z23qa002r3g64vvf6hjjz@published data-word-count=174><strong>Style: 21/25</strong><br>The Mini Coopers alone would carry the day here, but the mise-en-scène of the whole eponymous job is why this heist paved the way for decades of stylish dudes doin’ crimes. Start with the gang’s morning huddle at an abandoned, crumbling villa outside Turin — beautiful! Slippin’ and slidin’ through the arcades and galleries, yoinking a whole chicken off a café table? A+! Even the plans, as delivered via film reel by a debonair, smoking Beckermann, ooze panache. On the fashion side, Croker eventually swaps out his natty three-piece suits for a blue jumpsuit to match the rest of the crew, and while it’s perhaps a downgrade from the rest of the movie’s swinging London style, they really do look like a well-oiled machine, all, uh … 15 of them. The biggest downside of this heist is that there are way too many personnel, and only about three of them get anything like a personality — which makes it hard to track who’s who and why we should care about any of them.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z23qb002s3g6438fbh0zv@published data-word-count=42><strong>Stakes: 3/15</strong><br>Once the threat of the mafia looms over them, there’s a little more of a vise around Croker’s gang.

The opening robbery, which kicks off the cat-and-mouse game between McCauley and Al Pacino’s Lt. Hanna, is brisk and brutal and inspired a zillion Grand Theft Autos to come. Trejo tracks the armored truck and radios its approach to Cheritto and Waingro, who are waiting in an underpass under the 110 freeway in a big-rig tow truck. McCauley and Shiherlis, in a phony ambulance, block the truck’s way long enough for the big rig to charge in and knock the armored truck over and off the road. The doors are blown open, and the loot is stolen before the police arrive. The only unplanned element, which is a thorn in McCauley’s side for the rest of the movie, is the lunatic Waingro, who goes off script and murders the three guards.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z23uw00353g642yn7ucz8@published data-word-count=93><strong>Style: 20/25</strong><br>This heist is all about efficiency, and everyone in the crew gets a jumpsuit, a bulletproof vest, and a hockey mask, resulting in a pretty damn intimidating visual effect.

He gives them everything they need to gain access into Mulligan Manor, but Veronica’s a stickler for details in her own right, and puts her crew through the ringer in order to ensure that they have all their bases covered. The most “I wouldn’t have thought of that” heist prep moment is the weight training — making sure the team has the strength and stamina to run with a bag of money containing the highest possible volume of bills that would make up $5 million. It pays off, and virtually every other aspect of the heist goes through as planned — until it’s time to make their escape.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z24oe00563g64mt4caij5@published data-word-count=33><strong>Style: 21/25</strong><br>Veronica’s crew goes with all-black and balaclavas to match the tough-as-hell, no-shits-given vibe of the entire movie. But no outfit will ever amount to the dazzling insta-movie-star cool of <a href=#>Cynthia Erivo running</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z24pg00583g64t8d9dsg1@published data-word-count=115><strong>Stakes: 15/15</strong><br>These aren’t the only life-and-death stakes on this list. But Widows gets to 15 because it makes you feel in your bones that the idea of American justice itself hangs on the outcome of this job. The money being stolen is meant to pay off crime boss Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry) after the late Harry’s crew robbed him of $2 million. The remaining $3 million will go toward ensuring that these four women have some security in the cold, corrupt, unfair world their husbands left them in. Of course, there’s a twist, but not enough people saw Widows for me to spoil it here — go rent it and find out for yourself.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z24p900573g64877wasdi@published data-word-count=89><strong>Lack of Collateral Damage: 8/15</strong><br>Debicki’s Alice takes a bullet from Jack’s dad (Robert Duvall) and Jack’s dad gets shot and killed by Linda. I almost don’t want to count that as collateral damage, since clearly the only reason he shows up during the robbery is so he can get shot (because he sucks). But a body count is a body count, I suppose. Jamal’s henchman Jatemme (Daniel Kaluuya) also tries to hijack the heist unsuccessfully, further proving that it’s unwise to take on an aggrieved Viola Davis & Co.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z24ps005a3g648bw1d8tr@published data-word-count=71><strong>Success: 15/20</strong><br>What does success in 21st-century America even look like? Steve McQueen would ask. The ladies get the bag, and in turn get some of their lives back, but the status quo of Chicago politics remains more or less intact.

There are acrobatics and zip lines. There are disguises upon disguises. There’s a whole fake vault constructed to practice in and create phony surveillance camera footage with. Some of it stretches the suspension of disbelief when you really get down to it, but the trick of Ocean’s Eleven is to have so many enjoyable moving parts that you never have a chance or reason to scrutinize any one of them for too long. The heist, and by extension, the movie, feels like one big magic trick, and the final fake-out is just audacious enough to be rewarding.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z24y7005s3g64b30ious1@published data-word-count=145><strong>Style: 25/25</strong><br>The greasy early-2000s Vegas bro-vibe has certainly soured in the real world, but there’s no getting around the fact that Steven Soderbergh knows how to shoot handsome men. He knows how to shoot all kinds of men, really — particularly eternal handsome man Elliott Gould — casually mythologizing them with a few quick strokes. There are probably about three too many in the titular obligatory 11 (the number is one of the few things Ocean’s Eight nailed), but most everyone, from the mystifyingly Cockney-accented Cheadle to the gravity-defying Qin get their moment in the sun. Still, for all Danny and Rusty’s exquisitely tailored, period-perfect suits, the image that lingers is Clooney and Damon, in their Mission: Impossible–ready <a href=#>tight black tees and leather vests</a>, cracking their glow sticks in the elevator shaft like they were about to go to the kinkiest, most high-security rave ever.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjr7z24y1005q3g6466d63x5g@published data-word-count=72><strong>Stakes: 3/15</strong><br>Most of the key players have something in it for them when it comes to ripping off casino boss Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) but most of it comes down to petty revenge — Reuben was driven out of business by Benedict; Benedict is now dating Danny’s ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts).
