He appears to have been involved in a hockey fight and lost a tooth. But that wasn’t the case, and he made it clear that he was undergoing mouth correction treatment.</p><p>One of the well-known race car drivers, Newgarden, began competing at a very young age. Early on, he developed a passion for racing, which prompted him to compete in go-kart races before pursuing a career in professional motorsports. He is the only American to win the prestigious Formula Ford Festival in England, a race that is renowned as a testing ground for young European drivers.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Josef Newgarden’s Teeth: What Happened To Them?">Josef Newgarden’s Teeth: What Happened To Them?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="What About Josef Newgarden’s Wife, Ashley Welch?">What About Josef Newgarden’s Wife, Ashley Welch?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="What Is Josef Newgarden’s Net Worth in 2022?">What Is Josef Newgarden’s Net Worth in 2022?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=josef-newgardens-teeth-what-happened-to-them></span>Josef Newgarden’s Teeth: What Happened To Them?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Josef Newgarden, the IndyCar St. Pete champion, has a legitimate reason not to smile, as he spoke about his dental issues. He is getting dental work done to fix his teeth, which prevented him from smiling.</p><p>During the 2019 Predators game, Pierre McGuire spoke with Newgarden on the NBC Sports Network about the problems with his teeth. In the interview, he shared a strong collection of stories about the circumstances surrounding his dental issue. He concocted the tale to explain how he engaged in combat with Nashville defenseman Roman Josi and lost a tooth.</p><p>Additionally, he said that he was born and raised in Tennessee and that he is actively attempting to establish himself as a native of Nashville. A little bit of a cowboy, tough, with a guitar, boots, and some missing teeth.</p><p>The race car driver said that his teeth were being fitted with reverse braces. When she was a child, he had braces and missing teeth, and dentists essentially ripped everything out and didn’t replace that tooth, which resulted in jaw difficulties. After experiencing a serious dental issue, he sought the advice of a dentist, who recommended that he start the entire procedure over in order to restore the opening and place the missing tooth.</p><p>Despite having a dental problem, he did well in the races. He also discussed the intense discomfort that caused him to hold his jaw open. Because of his tooth issue, he also struggled to eat for longer than 24 hours.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-about-josef-newgardens-wife-ashley-welch></span>What About Josef Newgarden’s Wife, Ashley Welch?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Most people are familiar with Ashley Welch as the spouse of IndyCar series champion Josef Newgarden. In 2019, Josef married Ashley, the love of his life, in a ceremony that took place in his hometown of Nashville.</p><p>On October 7, 2018, Newgarden said that the lovely woman had been his girlfriend for a while and that they had gotten engaged while touring Japan. They met in 2014 while Ashley was working at Tokyo Disneyland, and they were together for a considerable amount of time. For many years, Josef and Ashley had a long-distance relationship.</p><p>On April 20, 2022, Newgarden and his wife Ashley welcomed their first child, whom they named Kota Nicolai Newgarden. The couple was overjoyed to announce the arrival of their child. Newgarden shared a happy message on Instagram to share with his friends and family.</p><p>Ashley was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. She attended Georgia Perimeter College while a high school student and her parents still reside in Atlanta with her brother. She spent some time working at Disney World in Orlando, Florida before beginning her work at Disney Japan.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-josef-newgardens-net-worth-in-2022></span>What Is Josef Newgarden’s Net Worth in 2022?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The net worth of the 31-year-old IndyCar champion is reportedly about $1 million.</p><p>Newgarden is in the best physical state of his Indycar career as of the 2022 season. His primary source of income is car racing. He is a well-known racing driver who receives requests for brand endorsement from numerous companies.</p><p>On December 22, 1990, Newgarden was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in the United States.
