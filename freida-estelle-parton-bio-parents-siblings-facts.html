When she turned thirteen, she moved from her home in East Tennessee to Nashville and lived with her elder sister Dolly, who was struggling at the time to make her career in music.</p><p>Following in the footsteps of her sister, Freida also started her career in 1980, when she signed with Bearsville and began working on her debut album.

Also in 2003, her mother, <a href=# rel=noopener>Avie Lee, passed</a> away at the age of 80 after a long battle with cancer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=All_About_Estelles_Brothers_and_Sisters_You_Should_Know></span><strong>All About Estelle’s Brothers and Sisters, You Should Know</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Freida-Estelle-Parton-siblings-1.jpg><p>Parton and her siblings were all raised under the same roof.
