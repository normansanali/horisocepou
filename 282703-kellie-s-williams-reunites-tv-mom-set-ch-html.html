The series was about the Winslow family and their neighbor Steve Urkel.</p><p class=dh>The series was originally a spin-off of another sitcom titled "Perfect Strangers." However, it became much more popular than the latter as it won over fans and became a stellar part of ABC studios' TGIF programming.</p><p class=dh>"Family Matters" also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thelist.com/602846/whatever-happened-to-the-cast-of-family-matters/>tackled</a> topics of family issues as well as racial profiling.

She appeared alongside Actor Darius McCrary who portrayed her on-screen brother on "Family Matters."</p><p class=dh>In an interview with ET's Melicia Johnson, both actors <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/family-matters-stars-kellie-shanygne-williams-darius-mccrary-on-playing-siblings-once-again-155202>revealed</a> details about the movie in which they were set to reprise their roles as siblings.</p><p class=dh>The actress explained that McCrary was her first choice to play her brother in the movie, which she also co-produced under Dream Merchant Media, her family's production banner.</p><p class=dh>She explained that she decided to cast McCrary as her brother immediately after reading the script. He seemed like the perfect choice since she has great chemistry with him, and fans love seeing them together.</p><p class=dh>Williams and McCrary met while filming "Family Matters" as kids and have remained friends since. She explained she enjoyed being around him.</p><p class=dh>The actress declared they have always had a good time together, and it does not matter if they were having a barbecue or on a set working together; they always have fun.</p><p class=dh>McCrary, on his part, explained that being on set with Williams again felt so awesome and natural. He described the process of them working together as similar to riding a bicycle since they had no problems falling into character because of their chemistry.</p><p class=dh>He also explained how easy working with Williams is and further praised her generosity, professionalism, and kindness.</p><p class=dh>They also addressed the issues of whether or not there would be a revival of their famous "Family Matters" series. McCrary explained he could not confirm or deny the rumors.</p><p class=dh>The actor admitted there had been talks about it, but the process is much more complicated than people might think. He explained that some legal angles needed to be checked, and that may hinder a revival.</p><p class=dh>McCrary confessed that it had to do with issues regarding intellectual property and that there is a possibility they would be seen on TV again.</p><p class=dh>Willams added that even though they may never revive the series, the cast has kept in touch since the finale, which is one of the reasons she cast McCrary on "Christmas In Carolina."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DAUGHTER'S TV DEBUT AND CAST REUNION</strong></p><p class=dh>Williams's daughter Hannah Belle Jackson <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/entertainment/kellie-s-williams-merry-switchmas/>follows</a> in her mother's footsteps after landing her first movie role in the holiday movie "Merry Switchmas."</p><p class=dh>The movie is about identical twin sisters who switch places during their parents' annual Christmas celebration. The film then sees the family learn some details about themselves before the night ends.</p><p class=dh>Even though Williams did not specify Hannah\s particular role in the movie, she was very excited and supportive of her daughter for the opportunity. The veteran actress posted a picture on her Instagram handle to celebrate her daughter, which she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUkGMzarsh7/?utm_source=ig_embed">captioned</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Three generations (Me, Jo Marie, and my daughter) on the set of Merry Little Switchmas."</p><p class=dh>Present in the picture was <a class="me a" href=#>Williams</a>, her daughter, and Actress Jo Marie Payton who played Harriette Baines Winslow, Williams' mother on "Family Matters."</p><p class=dh>The photo sent fans into a frenzy as they flooded her comment section with demands for a revival of the "Family Matters."
