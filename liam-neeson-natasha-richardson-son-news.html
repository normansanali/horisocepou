At the time, she was married to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>fellow actor<strong> Liam Neeson</strong></a>, and they had two sons, Micheál, who was 14, and Daniel, who was 13. Now, 12 years later, <strong>Micheál Richardson</strong> is following in his parents' footsteps with his own acting career.</p><p>The 25-year-old spoke about joining the family business in <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a new interview with The Times</a>. He shared what it was like working alongside his father in the 2020 movie Made in Italy, the story of which echoes his own experience with losing his mother. He also talked about the way Natasha's memory lives on with him.</p><p>Read on to find out more about Neeson and Richardson's son, and for more on famous families, check out <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>13 Celebrities You Had No Idea Were Related</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Liam-Neeson-Micheal-Richardson.png><p>Micheál (pronounced meehall) stars with Neeson in the dramedy Made in Italy, which was released last summer. It follows a father and son, Robert and Jack, who go to Italy to repair a home that was owned by Robert's wife and Jack's mother before she died.</p><p>The script was passed along to Neeson because of how it resembles his own experience with loss, and he suggested his son star along with him. Still, the actor worried that working on the project could be painful for Micheál.</p><p>"No, I wasn't traumatized at all," Micheál told The Times, however. "There was so much love for the script, even among the crew. You know, people lose loved ones. That's a part of life and there were a lot of people involved who had. So there was this really kind of warm, vulnerable energy on set. At the times when it had to be emotional it made it sort of meaningful, in a way, if that makes sense. Also I feel it was sort of like a shedding. We shed a layer of loss in a way by creating this."</p><p>Read about another child of an actor who is starting his career after loss in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See James Gandolfini's Lookalike Son as Tony in the "Sopranos" Prequel</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Micheal-Richardson-in-Made-in-Italy.png><p>Prior to Made in Italy, Micheál had a few other roles. He popped up in Anchorman 2, appeared in the <strong>Natalie Portman</strong> film Vox Lux, and was in another movie with his dad, Cold Pursuit. He also acted on the series Big Dogs.</p><p>Micheál didn't always know he wanted to follow his parents into performing; he thought he might work in fashion. "I think acting is an amazing profession because it requires you to look at yourself and learn a lot about yourself," he said of his career to The Times. "Not a lot of professions allow you to do that. It's a sort of inward discovery of who you are. I think I'd have a really hard time acting if I didn't know myself."</p><p>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Natasha-Richardson-Liam-Neeson-e1624655764626.jpg><p>Micheál's name was originally Micheál Neeson, but he changed his surname to Richardson a few years ago. "It was mainly like a homage to my mother, a way to carry her with me," he told The Times. "Going into this industry, carrying her last name, it definitely inspires me and it is also comforting."</p><p>In addition to Neeson and Richardson, Micheál has another famous name in his family: His grandmother, Natasha's mother, is actor <strong>Vanessa Redgrave</strong>. In 2018, Redgrave told the Daily Mail of her <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>grandson's name change</a>, "That wasn't because he wanted to avoid his father's fame, which is enormous. He wanted to hold his mother close to him—because she was a remarkable actress.

"It can send you for a bit of a head spin, and so you just latch on to the tiny little memories, whether it's her laugh or her energy in the room or her cooking."</p><p>For another celeb kid stepping out from their parent's shadow, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Pierce Brosnan's Lookalike Son Paris on His Latest Magazine Cover</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmpaGRonqvscSspqdlnpbBor%2FHmmSroZOdrrOw0qilZqufo3qvsdasZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fliam-neeson-natasha-richardson-son-news.html&text=Liam%20Neeson%20%26amp%3b%20Natasha%20Richardson%27s%20Son%20Is%20Following%20in%20Their%20Footsteps&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fliam-neeson-natasha-richardson-son-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fliam-neeson-natasha-richardson-son-news.html&title=Liam%20Neeson%20%26amp%3b%20Natasha%20Richardson%27s%20Son%20Is%20Following%20in%20Their%20Footsteps" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fliam-neeson-natasha-richardson-son-news.html&title=Liam%20Neeson%20%26amp%3b%20Natasha%20Richardson%27s%20Son%20Is%20Following%20in%20Their%20Footsteps" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fliam-neeson-natasha-richardson-son-news.html&title=Liam%20Neeson%20%26amp%3b%20Natasha%20Richardson%27s%20Son%20Is%20Following%20in%20Their%20Footsteps" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fliam-neeson-natasha-richardson-son-news.html&description=Liam%20Neeson%20%26amp%3b%20Natasha%20Richardson%27s%20Son%20Is%20Following%20in%20Their%20Footsteps" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./manouchehr-hadi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Manouchehr Hadi">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lady-amelia-spencer-exudes-regal-elegance-micahel-kors-bridal-suit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lady Amelia Spencer exudes regal elegance in a fitted bridal suit">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
