She was born in 1985 and is now 38 years old; her date and month of birth are not known. Oulèye is an American national and proudly identifies with her African-American ethnic heritage.</p><p>Oulèye was born to her parents, Ousseynou (father) and Mariama (mother). Her mother is a native of Illinois and comes from a white ethnic background, while her father is a Senegal native and has African-American roots. Although she spent most part of her life in New York, Oulèye currently resides in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><h3><strong>She is Well-Read and Attended Schools Such as Oxford and NYU</strong></h3><p>Oulèye Ndoye holds one bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees. After high school, she enrolled at Spelman College, where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in International Studies in 2007.

Precisely when and where they met for the first time is not publicly known, but Warnock proposed to Oulèye in January 2016 at Historic MLK church in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>In the following month, on 14 February 2014, they walked down the aisle in a beautiful public ceremony at the Auburn Avenue Church in Atlanta. Sadly, their union was short-lived and didn’t stand the test of time. They got separated in November 2019 and finalized their divorce in May 2020. But before then, they welcome two children: a son named Caleb and a daughter named Chloe.</p><p>Nothing much is known about the kids except that Caleb was born in 2016 and Chloe in 2018. Following their divorce, the court granted both parties joint legal custody and physical custody to Oulèye. About the reason behind their divorce, neither Oulèye nor Raphael has disclosed any information in that regard.</p><p>As much as the public knows, Raphael Warnock has not remarried, and neither has Oulèye Ndoye. But there is no information about if she is dating anyone at the moment. The only obvious thing is that the former couple have since moved on with their lives and are focusing on their individual career, bagging many milestones and achieving success.</p><h2><strong>Oulèye Ndoye is a Health and </strong><strong>Human Rights Policy Advisor</strong></h2><p>Raphael Warnock’s ex-wife, Oulèye Ndoye, is an American health and human rights policy advisor.

She was born in the year 1985 in her hometown in Upstate, New York, United States of America. It is not known when exactly she celebrates her birthdays.</p><h3><strong>Did Raphael Warnock Run Over His Wife?</strong></h3><p>Raphael Warnock most likely did not run over his ex-wife. In March 2020, while they were still going through their divorce proceedings, Oulèye Ndoye accused her ex-husband Warnock of running over her foot with his car during an argument, but Raphael denied the accusation. The argument was regarding whether their children would travel to Senegal to visit Oulèye’s family. Upon the arrival of police at the scene, Ndoye was found very reluctant to show the responding police officers her foot.</p><p>However, when she eventually did, the officers “did not see any signs that Ms. Ouleye’s foot was run over”. According to Warnock, his ex was standing by the car when he slowly drove away, and he did not think he ran over her foot. It did not stop there; medical practitioners were also called to the scene, and upon arrival, they were unable to find any signs of injury on Ndoye’s foot. Hence, the police did not charge Warnock with any crime relating to the incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571Kxmpp2VqXqzrc%2BhmJ6kXayus7rOnKKsZZWteri1xZ5kqK2cmsamec2dprKdXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-raphael-warnocks-ex-wife-ouleye-ndoye.html&text=Meet%20Raphael%20Warnock%27s%20Ex-Wife%20Oulye%20Ndoye&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-raphael-warnocks-ex-wife-ouleye-ndoye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-raphael-warnocks-ex-wife-ouleye-ndoye.html&title=Meet%20Raphael%20Warnock%27s%20Ex-Wife%20Oulye%20Ndoye" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-raphael-warnocks-ex-wife-ouleye-ndoye.html&title=Meet%20Raphael%20Warnock%27s%20Ex-Wife%20Oulye%20Ndoye" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-raphael-warnocks-ex-wife-ouleye-ndoye.html&title=Meet%20Raphael%20Warnock%27s%20Ex-Wife%20Oulye%20Ndoye" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-raphael-warnocks-ex-wife-ouleye-ndoye.html&description=Meet%20Raphael%20Warnock%27s%20Ex-Wife%20Oulye%20Ndoye" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./real-housewives-of-new-jersey-queen-teresa-giudice-ties-the-knot-with-luis-louie-ruelas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Real Housewives of New Jersey 'queen' Teresa Giudice ties the knot with Luis 'Louie' Ruelas">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lady-kitty-spencer-princess-diana-niece.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Lady Kitty Spencer - Princess Diana's Niece Lady Kitty Spencer">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
