Actress Kathy Bates, who recently celebrated her 73rd birthday, has done this, and even more. She has achieved so much and done incredibly well for herself.</p><p class=dh>In 2003, at the age of 55, the actress was diagnosed with stage 1 ovarian cancer.

While going through all of this, the "American Horror Story" actress did not reveal her ordeal to the public. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/kathy-bates-on-battling-cancer-twice-and-lymphedema/>shared</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I didn't tell anybody.

Bates knew that she wanted to be that free and that proud of her journey.</p><p class=dh>About nine years after she first battled cancer, Bates was shocked when she felt the all-too-familiar extreme exhaustion and, upon an MRI scan, received a breast cancer diagnosis.</p><p class=dh>Without any hesitation, the Memphis-born actress swiftly opted for a double mastectomy. Knowing that the illness runs in her family, she could not take the risk. Her aunt had died from it, her mother had it, and so did her niece.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>EXPERIENCE WITH CANCER</strong></p><p class=dh>"My mother had had a radical mastectomy -- they took everything -- and her arm swelled terribly," the actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/news/221275_kathy_bates_on_cancer_battle_and_double_mastectomy>shared</a>. "She was always a very smart dresser and wore very nice clothes, and after the surgery, she couldn't fit into them anymore."</p><p class=dh>During the time she was battling the resurrected illness, Bates seemingly disappeared from social media. She finally came out two months after her surgery on Twitter <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/MsKathyBates/status/245897028926853120>to share</a> what had been happening.</p><p class=dh>Unafraid and unapologetic about her inspiring story, Bates shared her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.today.com/news/kathy-bates-reveals-cancer-battle-recovering-double-mastectomy-994172>cancer diagnosis</a> with her fans and followers, as well as the details of her double mastectomy.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>BATES' ADVOCACY</strong></p><p class=dh>The 73-year-old, who is now a proud ovarian cancer advocate, also revealed that although she conquered cancer with her double mastectomy, the journey after that was still <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/health/kathy-bates-talks-lymphedema-double-mastectomy-t170027>long and painful</a>.</p><p class=dh>In 2018, Bates joined other Hollywood stars, including Jennifer Garner, Reese Witherspoon, and Matthew McConaughey, during a fundraising event, Stand Up to Cancer.</p><p class=dh>Many people, both famous and not, have stood up to cancer in many ways across the globe. Most recently, a New Zealand <a class="me a" href=#>couple</a> raised a hefty amount of money after the woman's mother passed away from ovarian cancer.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>LYMPHEDEMA</strong></p><p class=dh>Despite being cancer-free, she had to deal with her biggest challenge yet: lymphedema, a disease that very commonly springs up after the removal of lymph nodes during cancer treatment.</p><p class=dh>Upon <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/health/kathy-bates-talks-lymphedema-double-mastectomy-t170027>discovering</a> that her lymph nodes were taken out during surgery, Bates left the examination room and headed outside. She was angry and sad, thinking that her career was on the brink of failing.</p><p class=dh>The condition, which led to swelling of her arms and legs, caused so much pain for the actress. With the right doctors, she was able to battle that out as well, revealing that weight loss <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/health/kathy-bates-60-lb-weight-loss-post-cancer-lymphedema/>greatly helped</a> with the post-cancer condition.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A SURVIVOR</strong></p><p class=dh>Born on June 28, 1948, Bates is an inspiring and strong cancer survivor who is not afraid to tell her story. She became the national spokesman for the Lymphatic Education and Research Network.</p><p class=dh>According to the star, around ten million people in America have the incurable disease.
