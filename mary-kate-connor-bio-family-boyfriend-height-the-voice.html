Mary Kate Connor from Team Blake was one recipient of the “Playoffs Pass.”</p><p>Since the first playoff is set to air on May 1st, let’s take some time to know who Mary Kate Connor is. Below, you will get to know Mary Kate’s The Voice journey, her age, family, boyfriend, and more.</p><h3><strong>Mary Kate Connor On The Voice</strong></h3><p>As per Mary Kate’s bio on NBC, her love for music began when she was a baby. She had her first musical experience at the age of 8 when she auditioned and landed the role of Young Cosette in a local high school production of “Les Misérables.” Luckily for MK, the show went on to be nominated for a National Theater Award and the whole cast had the opportunity to perform on the Kennedy Center stage.</p><p>Mary Kate continued her musical theatre journey and even won a National Youth Arts Award for Best Lead Actress for her performance as Ariel in “The Little Mermaid.”</p><p>As Mary Kate gathered more and more theatre experiences, she found out that she was meant to be a singer/songwriter rather than a stage actor.</p><p>Coming to her The Voice audition, the Virginia native sang “Stars” by The Nocturnals and had judges Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson go head-to-head against each other for her.</p><p>The new judge, Niall Horan, was the first one to deliver a comment. “The fact that you are 17 years old. I mean that’s just nuts. It was incredible to hear so much power and so much control. You’re going to be around here for a long time,” a former One Direction member said.</p><p>“I love how beautiful and tender it was. You’re like a younger Brandi Carlile,” Kelly commented. “Your voice is very soft and angelic,” Blake complimented.</p><p>Lucky Blake, Mary Kate chose him as her coach. In the battles, Blake Shelton put MK against Kylee Dayne and they had to perform Taylor Swift’s “Anti-Hero.”</p><p>Though the duo both sang beautifully, Blake chose Kylee as the winner, moving her on to the Knockouts Round. Faced with the possibility of an impossible choice, God’s Country singer gave Mary Kate the coveted “Playoffs Pass.”</p><p>Stone Bridge High School senior will perform on the Playoffs now, which is set to premiere on May 1, 2023,</p><h3><strong>Mary Kate Connor Boyfriend</strong></h3><p>As of April 2023, Mary Kate seemed to be dating no one.
