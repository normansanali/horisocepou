Manson admitted she felt intimidated showcasing herself to Vig, who produced bands she admired such as Nirvana, Sonic Youth, and The Smashing Pumpkins, and Vig added that the audition’s disorganized nature along with the Americans not understanding Manson’s Scottish accent caused communication problems. At the end of the Live tour, Angelfish imploded and Manson returned to Smart for a second try. She began to work on the then-skeletal origins of some songs and the band invited her to become a full-time member and finish the album; she co-wrote and co-produced the entire album with the rest of the band. In August 1994, Radioactive gave their permission for Manson to work with Garbage. The band’s debut album Garbage was released in August 1995, and went on to sell over 4 million copies, buoyed by a run of high charting singles including “Only Happy When It Rains” and “Stupid Girl.” Manson quickly became the public face of the band over the course of a tour that took the band through to the end of 1996. Echo & the Bunnymen had asked Manson to sing on their 1997 comeback album.</p><h2>Shirley Manson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Shirley Manson is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United Kingdom.

While she was acting in her group, Manson was approached by Goodbye Mr Mackenzie’s lead Martin Metcalfe to join his band. Manson embarked on a relationship with Metcalfe initially, but remained involved after splitting from him and became a prominent member of the group, performing keyboards, backing vocals and becoming involved in the band’s business side. Manson’s first release with the Mackenzies was a YTS release of “Death of a Salesman” in 1984. The group signed a major-label record deal with Capitol Records in 1987, and they released their first album Good Deeds and Dirty Rags, and their only UK top 40 entry “The Rattler”. In 1990, the group’s contract was transferred to Parlophone, another EMI label, but after two singles failed to chart Parlophone declined to release the group’s second album Hammer and Tongs.</p><p align=justify>Manson became the band’s chief songwriter for the follow-up record Version 2.0 which equalled the success of the band’s debut record after its May 1998 release. During the two-year tour in support of the record, Manson modelled for Calvin Klein. Manson lived in hotels throughout the recording periods of the debut and Version 2.0. The group recorded the theme song to the James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough, and Manson became the third Scotswoman to sing a Bond theme after Lulu and Sheena Easton. In the accompanying video, she portrays an android assassin. For the recording of Garbage’s third record throughout 2000, Manson became one of the first high-profile artists to write a blog online, while she decided to improve her guitar playing for the band’s next tour. Their third album, Beautiful Garbage, featured Manson’s most forward and personal lyrics to date. The album did not sell as well as its predecessors, but Garbage performed a successful world tour in support of it. During a concert at the Roskilde Festival, Manson’s voice gave out.
