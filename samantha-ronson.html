Samantha Ronson has DJed at some of the world’s most high-profile events, including the Super Bowl, MTV’s New Year’s Eve Show, the Cannes and Sundance Film Festivals, as well as parties hosted by celebrities such as Stevie Wonder, Ellen DeGeneres, and Jay-Z.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Samantha Ronson?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Samantha Ronson</a></p>was born Samantha Judith Ronson on August 7, 1977, in Camden, London. She is the daughter of Laurence Ronson, a real estate entrepreneur and music executive, and Ann Dexter-Jones, a socialite and writer. Laurence and Ann are both of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the Ronson surname was originally Aaronson. They split when Samantha was six years old, and Ronson relocated to New York City with her mother, brothers, and Ann’s lover, Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones.<p>Mick became Samantha’s stepfather in 1982, and he had two children with Dexter-Jones. Ronson’s older brother, Mark, is a musician and music producer who is married to actress Grace Gummer, Meryl Streep’s daughter, and has received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and multiple Grammys.</p><p>Samantha has a fraternal twin sister, Charlotte, who is a fashion designer. Ronson also has three half-siblings from her father’s marriage to Michele First, as well as two stepbrothers from Jones’ earlier relationships.</p><p>She is the niece of Gerald Ronson, a property magnate who was convicted of fraud, fraudulent accounting, and theft in 1990 for his role in the Guinness share-trading scam. Samantha attended Manhattan’s Chapin School before enrolling at New York University, where she studied philosophy and creative writing.</p><p>Samantha was the first rock musician to sign with the hip-hop company Roc-A-Fella Records, but the album she created and recorded there was never released. In 2003, she released the mixtape “Challah” with DJ AM, and the next year, she released two mixtapes with her brother, Mark, “Get High” and “Get S R – The C Ronson Mixtape.”</p><p>In 2016, she founded the pop band Ocean Park Standoff with Ethan Thompson and Pete Nappi, and they released a self-titled EP in 2017. Their single “Good News” peaked at number 12 on the “Billboard” Hot Rock & Alternative Songs list and number 13 on the “Billboard” Adult Top 40 chart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Samantha Ronson?</h2><p>She is currently 46 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Samantha Ronson’s net worth?</h2><p>She is estimated to be worth $8 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Samantha Ronson’s career?</h2><p>Ronson has stated about her beginnings as a DJ, “I got a call one night from a club where I used to hang out, and they were like, ‘Do you want to DJ?'” I said, ‘No way,’ but my friends said, ‘Come on, just do it.’ I was usually in the club, so I felt I might as well make money from it. She began to build a reputation for herself and finally began DJing full-time.</p><p>Samantha has performed as a DJ at events including the Super Bowl, the Sundance Film Festival, MTV’s New Year’s Eve show, the American Music Awards, and the Pan American Games. She became Hennessy’s official DJ in 2011 and designed footwear for Supra in 2009, 2010, and 2014.</p><p>Ronson co-owned the NYC nightclub The Plumm alongside actors Chris Noth, Simon Rex, and Jesse Bradford, singer/actor Joey McIntyre, and record mogul Damon Dash. Samantha was the first rock band to sign with Roc-A-Fella Records, and she released the singles “Fool,” “Built This Way,” “Pull My Hair Out,” and “If It’s Gonna Rain” under the label.</p><p>In 2004, “Built This Way” appeared in the teen comedy “Mean Girls,” while “Pull My Hair Out” was on the 2004 soundtrack for “The Woodsman.” Ronson also sang “Wanted,” a Rhymefest song, in the 2006 drama “Half Nelson.” She wrote and recorded the album “Red” for Roc-A-Fella, which was never published.</p><p>Samantha’s 2011 album “Chasing the Reds” was released on Broken Toy Records, her own label, and includes guest appearances by Slash and Phantom Planet’s Alex Greenwald. Ronson co-produced the album with Jimmy Messer, the former guitarist for the glam rock band Goudie, and penned the song “Skyscrapers” with her brother Mark.</p><p>Samantha formed the pop band Ocean Park Standoff in 2016 with vocalist Ethan Thompson and drummer Pete Nappi, and the following year, they released a self-titled EP. Their singles “Good News” and “If You Were Mine” (with Lil Yachty) peaked at #13 and #15, respectively, on the “Billboard” Adult Top 40 chart, and they performed “If You Were Mine” on the late-night talk show “Conan” in April 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqyYppmeqbWiedGopaynnmQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsamantha-ronson.html&text=All%20you%20need%20to%20know%20about%20Samantha%20Ronson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsamantha-ronson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsamantha-ronson.html&title=All%20you%20need%20to%20know%20about%20Samantha%20Ronson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsamantha-ronson.html&title=All%20you%20need%20to%20know%20about%20Samantha%20Ronson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsamantha-ronson.html&title=All%20you%20need%20to%20know%20about%20Samantha%20Ronson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsamantha-ronson.html&description=All%20you%20need%20to%20know%20about%20Samantha%20Ronson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ben-rickert-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Rickert Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./will-a-sebaceous-cyst-keeps-filling-up.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will a sebaceous cyst keeps filling up?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
