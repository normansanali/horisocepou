Two stars in the midst of controversy is as old as entertainment itself, though it seems like the amount of feuding has increased tenfold in the last decade. Whether it is drama within a show itself, such as <a href=#>the shocking Selling Sunsets season 6 drama</a>, or between two stars who have nothing to do with each other, like <a href=#>the numerous celebrities who have feuded with Kendall Jenner</a>, there is always something going on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One pairing that seems to constantly make news headlines is Hailey Bieber and <a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a>. Since Gomez and Justin Bieber split for good, <a href=#>there have been non-stop rumors and controversies surrounding his ex and his wife</a>. Some of these rumors have proved to have merit behind them, while others seem to be reaching.​​</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Selena Gomez's Friendship With Meryl Streep Is Surprising Given Her Wholesome Reputation</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-the-controversy-between-hailey-bieber-and-selena-gomez>What Is The Controversy Between Hailey Bieber And Selena Gomez?</h2><p>Fans have admired that through all this "feuding," Selena Gomez has not taken a single shot at her potential adversary. Instead, she minds her own business and remains unbothered by the controversy that swirls around her. As someone who is constantly dragged into these rumors, how does Selena remain so distant?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anyone who follows celebrity headlines, and even those who do not, have likely seen a handful of accusations regarding the feud between Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber. While Justin Bieber's ex-girlfriend and wife have publicly claimed there is no bad blood between them, Hailey constantly seems to throw shade towards Selena.</p><h2 id=is-hailey-bieber-jealous-of-selena-gomez>Is Hailey Bieber Jealous Of Selena Gomez?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been numerous controversies involving these two. <a href=#>Some of the more recent include "eyebrow gate,"</a> in which Hailey Bieber and her buddy Kylie Jenner not-so-subtly made fun of Gomez's eyebrows on social media. Then, when a video resurfaced of Bieber gagging after Taylor Swift's name was mentioned while Hailey co-hosted Drop the Mic, Selena quickly came to her defense and commented, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">So sorry, my best friend is and continues to be one of the best in the game</a>."</p><p>There is also much accusation towards Hailey Bieber being jealous of Selena Gomez, thus copying a lot of her lifestyle. Not only did she marry Justin Bieber mere months after he and Gomez split, but Hailey has been outed for copying Selena's style, and even started <a href=#>filming her own cooking videos for YouTube after Gomez's show aired</a>, entitling hers "What's in my Kitchen?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-has-been-focusing-on-her-career>Selena Gomez Has Been Focusing On Her Career</h2><p>In the last year alone, Selena Gomez has been involved in a number of Hollywood productions. In 2022, she reprised the animated role of Mavis in the film series Hotel Transylvania for Hotel Transylvania 4: Transformania. <a href=#>Gomez also came back for the second season of the hit show Only Murders in the Building</a>, of which fans are eagerly awaiting to see her again for season three.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hailey-bieber-s-cooking-show-what-s-in-my-kitchen-copies-selena-gomez-s-hbo-series-in-more-ways-than-one.jpg><p>Last year, the star also released a documentary following her life and struggles. While most people only see the stardom and fame she has achieved, My Mind and Me dives into her battle with mental health and lupus. Selena wanted this biography to be a raw portrayal of what she has faced and what life looked like for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/selena_gomez.jpg><p>Besides her work on our screens, Selena Gomez has also been adding several titles to her resume as a producer. Working from behind the camera, she was credited with four titles in 2022: Hotel Transylvania 4: Transformania, Mi Vecino El Cartel, Selena + Chef, and Only Murders in the Building. As of now, she also has 6 other productions in various stages of production, three of which are TV shows.</p><p>As an actress, she has been working on a few titles this year as well.

Back in early 2019, she started the makeup line Rare Beauty. Her company has all sorts of various face, lip, and eye makeup options and caters to a wide variety of skin tones and types. While it was popular from the start thanks to her star power alone, <a href=#>it has recently come to stand on its own</a>.</p><p>Gomez shares on the company's website why she started the brand in the first place, saying, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">​I think Rare Beauty can be more than a beauty brand</a>—it can make an impact.

Music has been a part of her life since the beginning, and in 2022, Gomez released a few new singles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first single she released last year is entitled "Let Somebody Go." It was so popular that she later released "Let Somebody Go (Kygo Remix)," "Let Somebody Go (Piano Version)," and "Let Somebody Go (Ofenbach Remix)." In August 2022, Selena partnered with Rema to make the song "Calm Down."

In 2020, the star started the television series Selena + Chef, where she works with various master chefs to learn new recipes, brush up on her skills, and learn new tips and tricks. The show already released four seasons and featured big names like Gordon Ramsay, Rachael Ray, and Jamie Oliver. Selena + Chef is expected to return for a fifth season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have loved Selena's kitchen adventures so much that she has secured two more deals with the Food Network. Besides her current show, she will be the star of a TV show that "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">will center around celebrations in the kitchen during the holidays</a>." We do not know much about that show yet, and it appears as though the show is currently untitled.</p><p>Her second show will take her across the United States as she travels to meet and work alongside some of America's most popular chefs. There will be a competitive aspect to this series, as her goal is to "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cook their most popular dishes when she visits their kitchens</a>."
