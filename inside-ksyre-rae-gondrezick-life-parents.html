She unexpectedly went fourth in the 2014 WNBA draft. Rae’s drafting was anticipated, but few people thought she would go in the first round, much less fourth overall. A video of Rae’s response reveals that she was as shocked and delighted as everyone else.</strong></p><p><strong>She entered the University of Michigan after graduating from Benton Harbor High School, where she had a standout first season. In the postseason, she left the team for “personal reasons” before moving to West Virginia.</strong></p><h2><span id=Where_was_Kysre_Gondrezick_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family>Where was Kysre Gondrezick born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family</span></h2><p>Ksyre Rae Gondrezick was born to Lisa and Grant Gondrezick on <strong>July 27, 1997</strong>, in Benton Harbor, Michigan. Before signing with the Phoenix Suns in the NBA, Grant played college basketball at Pepperdine University. While playing for Louisiana Tech, Lisa earned a national championship but was unable to make it to the WNBA.</p><p>Grant had a difficult time during his NBA career. After being given probation for his role in a narcotics conspiracy case, he missed the 1987–88 season. His cocaine addiction caused his NBA career to end too soon.</p><p>With the Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Clippers throughout his two NBA seasons, Grant averaged five points, two rebounds, and one assist a game. Thankfully, Grant overcame his cocaine addiction and revived his baseball career in Europe and the lower leagues.</p><h2><span id=Early_in_January_2021_Grant_abruptly_passed_away>Early in January 2021, Grant abruptly passed away</span></h2><p>Two days after her father’s passing, Rae lined up for West Virginia against Texas and scored 24 points in a remarkable act of bravery. Vic Shaefer, Texas’ head coach, lauded Rae’s work in trying circumstances after the game.</p><p>Vic remarked, “You’ve got to give the kid credit.” “I applaud her for her bravery today because what she did was brave,” I said. Take Me Home, Country Roads by John Denver reverberated through the coliseum as Grant’s teammates greeted her following the game. I’m sure her father is extremely proud of her.</p><p>Rae cites her experience playing basketball as the reason for her wits on the field, according to CBS. Being intelligent and clever, she added. “While I am not the most athletic, I am quite competent and have strong fundamentals. To leverage my background in basketball to just possess a knack for the ball on either the offensive or defensive end.</p><h3><span id=Ksyre_Rae_Gondrezick_once_scored_72_of_her_team8217s_80_points_as_a_high_school_basketball_player>Ksyre Rae Gondrezick once scored 72 of her team’s 80 points as a high school basketball player</span></h3><p>Kysre made basketball history in 2016 for Benton Harbor by becoming the first female in the history of the state to average over 40 points per game.</p><p>Her 72-point performance in a double-overtime victory in the district playoffs marked the high point of her season. In true Kysre style, she made an effort to minimize her accomplishment. She said to MLive:</p><p>“I can’t recall taking half of the photographs I did. The victory made me happier than anything else, though. I don’t want my performance to be the only thing people remember. Last night, my guys played incredibly well. Everyone is interested in discussing my 72 points, but nobody is interested in how I gained them.</p><p>Such performances are what the Indiana Fever anticipate from their draft pick. Although scoring 72 points in a WNBA game is virtually unfathomable, Kysre’s career with the Fever will be heavily reliant on her ability to do so. Although the Fever has two strong shooters in Kelsey Mitchell and Juliie Allemand in the backcourt, the team’s dependence on the two proved to be a liability last year.</p><p>Rae should lighten the strain on Kelsey and Julie so that Fever faces multiple shooting threats. Another part of Rae’s game that ought to stand out as a Fever player is playmaking. Although she doesn’t have particularly impressive passing abilities, the game-reading talents she received from her parents should enable her to be a key playmaker in the Fever offense.</p><p>Another justification given by the Fever general manager Tamika Catching for choosing Rae was her “championship attitude.”</p><p>According to Tamika, “We came into tonight focused on the fact that we need championship-type caliber guys in our organization.” The championship attitude was one of the traits on which we placed a lot of emphasis. She possesses that.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Who Is Hassan Whiteside’s Girlfriend?
