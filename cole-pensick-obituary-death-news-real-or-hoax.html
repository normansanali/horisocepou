According to current rumors, Cole is claimed to have died as a result of the injuries he sustained in the collision.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/886735_10151471773134630_216187540_o.jpg><p>However, Cole Pensick’s cause of death is still a mystery to the public. No one connected to Cole has also come forward to confirm the rumors. No other details were provided.</p><p>Cole’s close friends or family have not formally confirmed what happened. As was previously stated, the precise cause of death has not yet been established. When additional information becomes available, we will update it soon, so keep in touch.</p><h2>Cole Pensick Health Update</h2><p>There is no solid information about his accident and his health.</p><p>A crucial component of the Husker offensive line in 2013—a unit that has helped Nebraska become one of the top running teams in the Big Ten was Cole Pensick. Pensick started 12 of the 13 games that he participated in, starting 11, including 11 at the center and one at guard.</p><p>Pensick suffered a knee sprain against Michigan State and missed the final two games of the season as a result. He was another victim of the injury bug. Pensick’s remarkable performance as a senior was recognized when the Big Ten coaches selected him for the second team.</p><h2>Cole Pensick Family Details</h2><p>The player was born on October 10, 1990, and is the son of Dan and Bev Pensick. In December 2012, Pensick graduated from Nebraska with a bachelor’s degree in agribusiness.</p><p>In the fall and spring semesters of 2012–13, he was recognized on the Nebraska Scholar-Athlete Honor Roll.
