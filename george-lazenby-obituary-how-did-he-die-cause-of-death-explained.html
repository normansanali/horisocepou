He was the second actor in the Eon Productions film series to portray fictional British secret agent James Bond in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969). Lazenby’s tenure as Bond is the shortest of all of the series actors, having appeared in just one film. Lazenby, who started his acting career as a model, had only featured in commercials until he was cast as the first Bond actor, Sean Connery. He refused to participate in subsequent Bond films and pursued acting opportunities during the 1970s. His career was halted during this period, so he got into business and made real estate investments.</p><p>Lazenby later portrayed roles that ridiculed the James Bond character. In the 2017 Hulu documentary Becoming Bond, Lazenby described his life story and Bond identity. Continue reading to find out what caused George Lazenby’s death.</p><h2>George Lazenby’s Cause of Death And Obituary</h2><p><strong>George Lazenby’s cause of death</strong> has been revealed, but the motive behind it remains unknown. On June 3, 2023, he died at the age of 84. His death might have been caused by old age or an unspecified ailment. In 1963, Lazenby moved to London to be with a lady he had fallen in love with. He began selling old cars in Finchley before moving on to selling new cars in Park Lane, where a talent scout discovered him and persuaded him to become a model. Lazenby quickly earned £25,000 each year. He rose to prominence after starring in a commercial for Fry’s chocolate bars. In 1966, he was named Top Model of the Year.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/George-Lazenby-1.jpg alt="George Lazenby" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>How Did the Australian Actor Pass Away?</h2><p>As the death of an Australian actor has acquired attention, many are curious about the reason for his death, which has yet to be disclosed. He was 84 years old, therefore we may assume he died of an illness. Lazenby was born in Ovada Private Hospital in Goulburn, New South Wales, on September 5, 1939, to Sheila Joan Lazenby, a shop associate at a Fossey’s store, and George Edward Lazenby, a railroad worker. He attended Goulburn High School till 1954, having previously attended Goulburn Public School.</p><p>Barbara, his sister, was an accomplished dancer. He underwent surgery when he was young, which left him with just half a kidney, and he remained in the hospital for 18 months.&nbsp;Lazenby’s family moved from Goulburn to Queanbeyan when he was around 14 years old, where his father had a shop.&nbsp;He worked as a mechanic and car salesman after serving in the Australian Army.</p><h2>George Robert Lazenby’s Early Life: Is He Married?</h2><p>In 1973, Lazenby married <strong>Chrissie Townson</strong>, a Gannett family member and his three-year lover.&nbsp;After that, Zachary and Melanie were their children. Zachary was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor at the age of eleven and died at the age of 19. Melanie earned her real estate broker license in New York.&nbsp;In 2002, Lazenby married Pam Shriver, a former tennis player. In 2005, they had three children, including twins.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/George-Lazenby-2.jpg alt="George Lazenby" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shriver and Lazenby filed for divorce in August 2008, according to sources. In court filings filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, the phrase “irreconcilable differences” appears.&nbsp;Their divorce was formally finalized in May 2011. Lazenby lives in Brentwood, Los Angeles. He used to live in Pacific Palisades.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGienqeinLJuuMCznKeaqWK8o7XTrpirsV2dvLh5w6KbZqCVYrGqsYycmK6rlWK8p3nDnpitoF2axbG4wKKlnpxf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeorge-lazenby-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html&text=George%20Lazenby%20Obituary%3a%20How%20Did%20He%20Die%3f%20Cause%20Of%20Death%20Explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorge-lazenby-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-lazenby-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html&title=George%20Lazenby%20Obituary%3a%20How%20Did%20He%20Die%3f%20Cause%20Of%20Death%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeorge-lazenby-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html&title=George%20Lazenby%20Obituary%3a%20How%20Did%20He%20Die%3f%20Cause%20Of%20Death%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-lazenby-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html&title=George%20Lazenby%20Obituary%3a%20How%20Did%20He%20Die%3f%20Cause%20Of%20Death%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorge-lazenby-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html&description=George%20Lazenby%20Obituary%3a%20How%20Did%20He%20Die%3f%20Cause%20Of%20Death%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./howie-mandel-sofia-vergaras-divorce-joke-walked-off-americas-got-talent-stage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Howie Mandel's Jokes About Sofia Vergara's Divorce Were So Uncomfortable That She Walked Off America">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./devon-aoki-ethnicity-nationality-race-family-body-measurements-career-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Devon Aoki Ethnicity, Nationality, Race, Family, Body measurements, career">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
