Like Davis, her husband Julius Tennon is also an actor, however, he has not been able to enjoy as much success as his wife has recorded. Read on to see all that we have been able to find out about him, including details about his career, personal life among other facts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-julius-tennon-and-how-old-is-he></span><strong>Who is Julius Tennon and How Old is He?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Julius Tennon was born Julius William Tennon on the 24th of December, 1953 in Travis County, Texas. Information regarding his family background is not available. It is also not clear if he has any siblings or is an only child.</p><p>As a boy, Tennon had hoped to become an actor. It further helped his cause that his teachers admired his speaking voice, prompting them to always cast him in school plays and give him poetry to read. One of his most notable performances at the time was the “I Have a Dream” speech by Martin Luther King Jr. In addition to his acting ambitions, Tennon was also keen on playing sports. His sporting ability went a long way in helping him secure a full football scholarship to the University of Tulsa where he majored in theatre.</p><p>After completing his education, Julius Tennon moved to launch his acting career. Some of his early notable performances came in the films Confession of a Serial Killer (1985), Adam: His Songs Continues (1986), and The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987). He also appeared in the miniseries Lonesome Dove (1988-1989). In the 1990s, he landed a role in the commercially successful film Dazed and Confused (1993), and further appeared in others like Small Soldiers (1998), Friday Night Lights (2004), Won’t Back Down (2012), and Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Other television shows in which he appeared in include Criminal Minds, ER, and City of Angels.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=julius-tennons-husband-kids></span><strong>Julius Tennon’s Husband & Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is public knowledge that Julius Tennon is actress Viola Davis’ husband. Prior to them exchanging vows, however, Tennon had embarked on two failed marriages; first to a woman identified as Sheryl Lynn Arnold from 1974 to 1980, and then to another identified as Christine Dejohnna White from 1992 to 1998. From those relationships, he welcomed two children who he raised all by himself.</p><p>Tennon found love again when he began dating Davis some time in the late 90s. According to the actress, Tennon came into her life three weeks after she had intensely prayed for a husband. She was at the time going through loneliness, having been alone in Los Angeles, a town in which she said she hated at the time. The two met while filming an episode of City of Angels, where Tennon offered to show her around town and take her to the Santa Monica Pier. A four-year-long relationship followed after that, leading to them becoming man and wife in June 2003.</p><p>Speaking in an interview, Viola Davis said what endeared Julius Tennon to her was that he was a single father for almost two decades, raising his children by himself and also pursuing an acting career. This showed her that he had character and was a good man, setting himself apart from all the other men she had dated in the past. The couple appeared together in a documentary on the OWN Network titled Black Love, where they open up about what their marriage is like.</p><p>On the 18th of October, 2011, Tennon and Davis adopted a baby girl named Genesis.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=julius-tennons-net-worth></span><strong>Julius Tennon’s Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After having appeared in more than 50 films and television series throughout his acting career, and begun another career as a producer, Julius Tennon has surely been able to accumulate a significant amount as his net worth. Exact estimates of what that figure might be, however, is still under review. His wife, on the other hand, is said to worth about $12 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-interesting-facts-about-viola-davis-husband></span><strong>Other Interesting Facts About Viola Davis Husband</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>1.</strong> Julius Tennon was one of the very first African-Americans to venture into the theatre. His talent was further dully recognized by both his teachers and critics as he went on to win quite a number of awards.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> He and his wife are founders of the production company, JuVee Productions. The company aims to bring to the mainstream the stories of minorities that the general public are not familiar with.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Tennon stands at a height of 5 feet 8.5 inches and weighs about 83 kg.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35uttSloK6rXamyr7rOp2SboZ9is6K5yKWwZqSZm7JussCcq6xlkZe8tsCMr6CopJFisaLCyKxkoa2jl66vsI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2021-julius-tennon-bio-family-life-facts-about-viola-davis-husband.html&text=Julius%20Tennon%20%20Bio%2c%20Family%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Facts%20About%20Viola%20Davis%20Husband&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2021-julius-tennon-bio-family-life-facts-about-viola-davis-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2021-julius-tennon-bio-family-life-facts-about-viola-davis-husband.html&title=Julius%20Tennon%20%20Bio%2c%20Family%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Facts%20About%20Viola%20Davis%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2021-julius-tennon-bio-family-life-facts-about-viola-davis-husband.html&title=Julius%20Tennon%20%20Bio%2c%20Family%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Facts%20About%20Viola%20Davis%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2021-julius-tennon-bio-family-life-facts-about-viola-davis-husband.html&title=Julius%20Tennon%20%20Bio%2c%20Family%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Facts%20About%20Viola%20Davis%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2021-julius-tennon-bio-family-life-facts-about-viola-davis-husband.html&description=Julius%20Tennon%20%20Bio%2c%20Family%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Facts%20About%20Viola%20Davis%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kateryna-baindl-husband-who-is-michael-baindl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kateryna Baindl husband: Who is Michael Baindl?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-tyr-actually-dead-the-fate-of-the-norse-god-of-war.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Tyr Actually Dead?
