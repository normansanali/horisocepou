She has been a constant source of love and support for her family since she married Rob. They have three children together, but details about their personal life are purposely kept confidential. Robbert Allen Ryan is an American football coach whose primary concentration is defense. Ryan started his coaching career in 1987 as a graduate assistant at Western Kentucky University.</p><p>He later coached at other institutions, including Tennessee State University and Ohio University, improving his game talents and expertise. Furthermore, Ryan began his NFL career as a defensive backs coach with the Arizona Cardinals in 1994.&nbsp;Following his tenure with the Cardinals, he went on to coach the New England Patriots, Cleveland Browns, Oakland Raiders, Cleveland Browns, Orleans Saints, Las Vegas Raiders, and other notable clubs.<br>In addition to teaching, Fox Sports hired him as a host in September 2017. In 2018, he also began working as a weekly commentator for Sky Sports’ NFL coverage in the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p><h2>Meet Rob Ryan’s Wife Kristin Ryan</h2><p><strong>Kristen Ryan</strong> is married to Robert Allen Ryan, an accomplished NFL football coach. They have three children together.&nbsp;Kristen’s work life may not get the same emphasis as her husband’s, but she is a supporting partner to him.&nbsp;She is also recognized for being kind and caring. It was clear when she donated a basket full of goods to the New School morning program. Kristen Ryan made news in 2012 when she announced that Rob Ryan had lap band surgery.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Rob-Ryan-1.jpg alt="Rob Ryan" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rob had the procedure to shed weight, following in the footsteps of his brother, Rex Ryan.&nbsp;Kristen stood by her husband’s side even after the procedure failed. She gave him constant love and support throughout his adventure.&nbsp;Kristen Ryan, despite her desire to keep a low profile, plays an important part in her family and husband’s NFL career.</p><h2>Rob Ryan’s Married Life and Children</h2><p>Robert has a discreet but treasured marital life and family. Married to Kristen Ryan, they have three children.&nbsp;Although specifics about their family life are kept hidden from the public, his dedication to his family is clear in his attempts to achieve a balance between his rigorous coaching duties and his position as a dedicated husband and father.</p><p>While Rob’s professional successes often make headlines, his commitment to his family remains unwavering. Despite Rob’s high-profile job in the NFL, he and Kristen value their family’s privacy. The rationale for this might be to foster a feeling of normality and connection in their family.&nbsp;They treasure times of togetherness away from the public spotlight, focusing on their family’s well-being above everything else.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Rob-Ryan-2.jpg alt="Rob Ryan" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rob’s legacy goes beyond his coaching accomplishments to include the love and support he provides for his family. His dedication to his spouse and children reflects his character, honesty, and devotion.&nbsp;His leadership, both on and off the field, inspires others around him. This demonstrates the importance of family among the obstacles to a successful professional sports career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipqJpdp8aiuoywoJ%2BdXay1sHnIrGSkqpmowaq6jKuwmqZdp7KtrdOipqermJ69bq3NnWSkoZSoeqWx05qgpWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frob-ryan-wife-who-is-kristin-ryan-relationship-and-kids-detail.html&text=Rob%20Ryan%20Wife%3a%20Who%20Is%20Kristin%20Ryan%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Kids%20Detail&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frob-ryan-wife-who-is-kristin-ryan-relationship-and-kids-detail.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frob-ryan-wife-who-is-kristin-ryan-relationship-and-kids-detail.html&title=Rob%20Ryan%20Wife%3a%20Who%20Is%20Kristin%20Ryan%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Kids%20Detail" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frob-ryan-wife-who-is-kristin-ryan-relationship-and-kids-detail.html&title=Rob%20Ryan%20Wife%3a%20Who%20Is%20Kristin%20Ryan%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Kids%20Detail" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frob-ryan-wife-who-is-kristin-ryan-relationship-and-kids-detail.html&title=Rob%20Ryan%20Wife%3a%20Who%20Is%20Kristin%20Ryan%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Kids%20Detail" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frob-ryan-wife-who-is-kristin-ryan-relationship-and-kids-detail.html&description=Rob%20Ryan%20Wife%3a%20Who%20Is%20Kristin%20Ryan%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Kids%20Detail" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sergio-busquets-net-worth-age-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sergio Busquets Net Worth, Age, Height">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ricky-ponting-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ricky Ponting Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
