Simpson was a sought-after celebrity. Not only that, but he was super-rich by '90s standards, worth a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported $10.8 million</a> at the time. But as the public already knows, Simpson lost most of his net worth following not one but two criminal trials, one for murder and one for theft that would actually land him in prison.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His money situation has been complicated ever since he was on trial for the murders of both Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, but where do his finances stand today, and how is he making money?</p><h2 id=how-did-o-j-simpson-lose-his-net-worth>How Did O.J. Simpson Lose His Net Worth?</h2><p>Most people who followed his criminal trial know that O.J. Simpson was ultimately required to pay $33.5 million dollars in a wrongful death suit after he was acquitted of murder but faced a civil suit brought by the families of the victims.</p><p>In short, O.J. was on the hook for those millions, and the court was able to take his earnings from various sources, including sales of a book under his name. Yet there was <a href=#>one income source he maintained while in prison</a> that the court and the victims' families couldn't touch; his NFL pension.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-does-o-j-simpson-have-now>How Much Money Does O.J. Simpson Have Now?</h2><p>Over time, that consistent income from Simpson's pension -- of an impressive $25K per month -- helped rebuild some of his former net worth. But for a time, that seemed to be the former football player's only income source.</p><p>After all, he didn't seem to earn anything <a href=#>from the 'The People V. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story' show</a>, despite being the titular character, and he wasn't consulted prior to its production or release.</p><p>But his other income stream from the NFL, plus a bit of a pension from the Screen Actors Guild (Simpson was an actor for a brief period), means O.J. is setting relatively pretty with a net worth around $3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-o-j-simpson-do-for-a-living>What Does O.J. Simpson Do For A Living?</h2><p>Though he apparently tried to <a href=#>expand his spotlight by joining TikTok</a>, not much is known about O.J. Simpson's current business or financial moves. However, there's one telling detail that explains how he might be getting by these days without his multiple millions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 1995 O.J. Simpson Trial Tore The Kardashian Family Apart, And Here's Why</a></span></p><p>While $3 million is nothing to scoff at -- nor is his pension cash -- it seems that Simpson moved out of state to avoid having to pay the remaining settlement to the Brown and Goldman families. If he's successful in avoiding that drain on his income, it would seem that O.J. could sign on to some other opportunities and not worry about losing whatever cash he makes.</p><p>Not that it'll be easy -- in the court of public opinion, Simpson is still largely considered guilty of murder, so opportunities to cash in on his infamy are likely few and far between.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>O.J.
