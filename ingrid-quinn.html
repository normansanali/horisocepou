He had to work three to four nights a week for the shoot, and as a result, Ingrid became jealous and skeptical when her husband became comfortable with a female cast member of ‘Angel and Buffy.’</p><p>Ingrid would frequently pay him a surprise visit to check on him, but Davis did not appreciate her spying on him and filed for divorce after only five days of separation. The couple was unable to maintain their relationship and divorced in 1999, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple had no children together. Their divorce was caused by her ex-friendship husbands with his co-stars.</p><p>Following their divorce, David married actress Jamie Bergman on November 24, 2001, and the couple has two children: Jaden Boreanaz and Bella Boreanaz.
